And there is so much more, I guess I will remain an absolute beginner for ages to come. And if you're an absolute beginner, having a basic understanding of these functions will help you sail through a lot of code reading and writing.\n\n  \n\n\n## How to read this cheat sheet\n\nIn the given cheat sheet, I have used syntax in Haskell. Even if you don't understand Haskell, and you have never used it, with a little bit of syntax knowledge you will see that it is similar to Python with types sprinkled. As we progress, I may use the functions used before somewhere later, but I have kept this really small so just hover over the page and you'll find it. Let's now go over the basic syntax in Haskell first. If you know Haskell basic syntax, you can [skip this section](#fp_cheat_sheet) entirely.\n\n  \n\n\n### Function Syntax\n\nIn Haskell, everything is a function. These functions can be composed together, in turn creating other functions. Each function begins with its name. And then the input and output types. One thing here we need to remember here is this: **all functions take exactly one parameter**. You may obviously ask, then what do you do when we need more that one parameter? From the current function you return another function that again takes one parameter. In fact, there is not much emphasis on what a function 'returns'. There is no such distinction. The emphasis is on what is the **type signature**. A type signature is just an arrow separated list of what type is the input and what type is the output. Let's go over an example.\n\n  \n\n\nLet's define a function that takes an integer, adds 1, and returns another integer:  \n\n\n      addOne :: Int -> Int\n      addOne x = x + 1\n\n      \n\nNow this goes by the law, as `addOne` needs to take only 1 parameter. Let's move over to another function `add`, that takes two numbers and adds them to return another number:\n\n      add :: Int -> Int -> Int\n      add x y = x + y\n\n      \n\nThis function `add` actually takes one param only, that is the first integer x, and then it returns another function, that takes the second integer y and then returns the final value. So now I am going to cease writing (and stop thinking) in terms of what a function takes as input, and what it returns as output. Instead, let us think of it in terms of what the type signature is.\n\nAlso, functions can be named as symbols also. In this cheat sheet, I have mentioned the common name for the functions written as symbols.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n### Point Free Notation\n\nRemember in mathematical equations how we could cancel a variable from both sides of an equation? We can do something similar here, but of course, there are some conditions. One that I use is this: _We can remove an input parameter name, if it is the last parameter and is being used on both sides of the function_. e.g. `addOne` can be shortened as:\n\n      addOne :: Int -> Int\n      addOne = (+1)\n\n      \n\nNow, this is not a strict rule, and I am not sure how valid this rule stands. We can read more about it in the [Haskell wiki](https://wiki.haskell.org/Pointfree).\n\nPoint free notation makes the code look a lot cleaner, and more importantly, it is very useful in composing functions together. If we don't understand function composition, we can think of Unix pipes, where, the output of one command goes as input to another command. Just as easily we can 'pipe' our functions together by using point-free notation.\n\n  \n\n\n### List Syntax\n\nLists in Haskell are just written by wrapping comma-separated elements in square brackets. For representing types as a list of some other type, say `Int`, can be written as `[Int]`. For a generic type `a`, a list of type `a` is written as `[a]`.\n\n  \n\n\nI am purposefully not going into more details of Haskell syntax, as I want this to be focussed on general FP and not particularly Haskell. There are plenty of resources that we can learn Haskell from and I am trying hard to not convert this post into a Haskell tutorial.\n\n## FP Cheat Sheet\n\nHaving said that, here is the list of functions, definitions, constructs I keep coming back to again and again, whenever I have to read FP code or write a functional style code.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nHope this list would be helpful to someone (other than me!). All these functions are a topic in themselves and deserve a separate blog post for each of them. I also have tried to explain a lot of such FP practices using Scala and Haskell [here](https://blog.amitashukla.in/2019/07/unfolding-folds.html), [here](https://blog.amitashukla.in/2017/06/implement-functional-list-from-scratch-scala.html), [here](https://blog.amitashukla.in/2017/03/tail-recursion-in-functional-programming.html) and [here](https://blog.amitashukla.in/2017/02/why-functional-programming.html). I have also refrained from mentioning the laws associated with type classes to which most of these functions belong, but they also form an interesting read.\n",

There's a lot of emphasis on what techniques to use for processing data, be it for data analysis, or data science, or big data depending on the scenario. But just like for Physics problems we assume negligible air resistance, friction, etc., for data problems we assume negligible poor quality data. In real life though, poor quality data is not so negligible. In fact, it is substantial and significant effort goes into data preparation before it is ready to be consumed by our data science models.  \n  \nWe will be talking about these cleaning efforts here.  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://i.redd.it/pqtv2tnlwpb41.jpg)](https://i.redd.it/pqtv2tnlwpb41.jpg)\n\n  \nWhen I say 'cleaning up the data' what does it actually mean? Mostly it depends on your problem. At first, you may get your data from some source in a very unstructured format, like, from a website. For extracting the content of a web page, you would scrape through it, and with that, you would get a lot of gibberish along with the actual content. You might not need all of it though.  \n  \nIn this post, I will walk through where I applied it in my project: [Relevance of News Articles w.r.t. Economic News](https://github.com/amita-shukla/nlp-economic-news). Given a number of news articles, the goal is to detect if that article is relevant to U.S. economy (I'm choosing U.S. because that's the data set I got from here). This project is mainly text-heavy, so I will move ahead with discussing Natural Language Processing techniques I used.  \n  \nTo begin with, from all the news articles, I have chosen a random article, let's call it `sample_text`:  \n  \n  \n\n\n### Clean HTML\n\nThe first step is to eliminate the HTML style tags. Now for this purpose, the first thought that comes up is to use regex. However, it soon got a bit complicated...  \nAnd then I came across [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454?stw=2#1732454):  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eH4h7c8eN_w/XnZ09LAtTnI/AAAAAAAAM1A/pjBimgQsWpkgl1guCDHTdU3Jh8HY_P87wCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/stackoverflow_regex_parser.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eH4h7c8eN_w/XnZ09LAtTnI/AAAAAAAAM1A/pjBimgQsWpkgl1guCDHTdU3Jh8HY_P87wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/stackoverflow_regex_parser.png)\n\n  \n  \nAnd therefore, I went ahead to use the well-known python library BeautifulSoup.  \n  \n  \n\n\n### Process Single Quotes\n\nNow as you see in the sample_text, there are a lot of special characters there. On some investigation, I observed that the pattern `'\\x89Ûª'` is basically the substitute of an apostrophe or a single quote. Therefore, particular to this data, I removed the pattern:  \n  \n  \n\n\n### Expand Contractions\n\nBut now the question that arises: do we want these apostrophes to processed as single words later? Suppose, if a word is _America's_, I know that the important word here is _America_ and not the apostrophe. But this might get treated as a separate word later. Therefore, I need to **decontract** these words, meaning I expand these words into their natural form. How to do it? Just by using simple regex replace.  \n  \n  \nNow this is not entirely accurate because I see words such as _he's_, or _let's_, which get transformed into _he is_ and _let is_ respectively. But I chose to ignore them as these words are unimportant and would get eliminated later.  \n  \n\n\n### Remove Special Characters\n\nAs you see in the `sample_text3` above, there are still some special characters left that seem to add no meaning to the content of news articles. Time to extract them out.  \n  \n  \n\n\n### Trim Extra Spaces\n\nIn the above part section, I substituted the special characters with spaces `' '` instead of an empty string `''`.  \n  \n  \nThis was done after careful consideration, because some characters were actually acting as hyphens (-) and replacing hyphens with nothing resulted in two words joined together. And this would have been difficult to separate out. Hence, just trim these extra spaces.  \n  \n\n\n### Tokenize words\n\nNow that we have dealt with the processing on the complete text, we can go on now to take things word-wise. But how do we create words out of text (This is called **tokenization**)? It's simple: split by space. But is it this simple? Because when we treat text as just a bunch of characters separated by spaces, we create a lot of meaning-less words when we split such a text. This is because, practically, text contains punctuation too. So if we split this text by spaces, what we get is a lot of words with punctuation attached: which for a program these are completely new words.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nSo what? You would say. Just remove the punctuation marks! I tried something like this:  \n  \nAt least for my case, this did not turn out to be that simple. Because while removing punctuation marks and then splitting the text by space sanitized my words, a lot of meaningful words got lost. e.g. _U.S.A._: this word gets split into 3 separate words: _U, S, A_. Totally meaningless.  \n  \nThe Solution I derived was using the function `word_tokenize` from `nltk` library, which is more intelligent in generating such tokens.  \n  \nFor a term like _u.s.a._  \n  \n  \nFor our `sample_text`, these were the tokens generated. Observe that these tokens have periods and commas and other punctuation generated as separate tokens, which can be filtered as given in the code above. But `word_tokenize` from `nltk` is smart enough in not splitting all the words by punctuation, such as the phrases _28-year-old_ and _U.S._ are treated as single tokens.  \n  \nObviously, this generic tokenizer is not fool-proof, as you would see some totally useless tokens generated, such as _years.Poland_. But this is a trade-off: you can either decide to handle each and every special case yourself, or give way to a bit more generalization.  \n\n\n  \n\n\nWhat is to be done with these token you ask? Let's move on to the next step.\n\n  \n\n\n### Stem Text\n\nThis is an important lesson (and the most commonly used) when it comes to Natural Language Processing.\n\nWhen we want to process the data, we usually need to determine the count of the occurrences of a word. For example, for our problem to detect economic news for US economy, we may need to count the number of times (frequency) the words such as _economy_, _America_, _USA_, _dollars_ etc occur in a given news article. But, as these articles are written in natural English, each English word may occur in a different form, such as, for _economy_different words can be _economic, economical, economics_ etc. Now, these words are to be treated in the same way by our model. How to do that? By reducing all these words to the same word, i.e. by reducing it to its root form.\n\nSo, _economy_ gets reduced to_economi_.\n\nThis reduction of words to its canonical roots is achieved by two techniques, Stemming and Lemmatization. Let's go over both of them.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Stemming v/s Lemmatization\n\nWhile the purpose of both techniques is the same, the results are quite different. Stemming relies on a set of certain rules to derive the root of a word. In a linguistic sense, these derived roots might not be actual words. Consider that Stemming applies a formula for a word to derive the result. It may remove prefixes, suffixes etc.\n\nLemmatization, on the other hand, relies heavily on linguistics knowledge. A proper dictionary, vocabulary and morphological analysis (the study of how a word is formed, from what language(s) etc.) is needed.\n\nWhat do we need for our purpose? I tried both:  \n  \n\n\n#### Stemming\n\nI used the `PorterStemmer` from `nltk` library for this purpose:  \n  \n  \n\n\n#### Lemmatization\n\nI used the `WordNetLemmatizer` from the nltk library for this purpose:  \n  \n  \n\n\n-   Though lemmatizer looks better to the human eye, it fails to solve our purpose. This is because of the way we're going to use these processed tokens. On passing these tokens to some vectorizer later (in very simple terms, [**vectorizers**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/feature_extraction.html#text-feature-extraction) are used to turn text into vectors, to be processed later by the model), the number of features using stemmer turn out to be less than what lemmatizer produced. You can think of 'number of features' as the number of unique words generated. The frequency of these unique words decides how much they dominate the model results, hence acting as a feature. As the lemmatizer tries to generate a perfect English language word (lemma), it generates a lot more unique root words than the Stemmer overall. The number of features needs to calibrated very carefully for the overall performance of our model (threw me an OutOfMemory error), or even, may cause our data to [**overfit**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting).\n-   Theoretically too, a Stemmer is far simpler, and faster than Lemmatizer.\n-   Lemmatizer is stricter than Stemmer.\n-   Hence, for data science problems where the focus is not on the linguistics and it's not a language application but on using the text as input, we do not need such aggressive and perfect reduction of words that Lemmatizer provides. Stemming is usually sufficient.\n\n  \n\n\n### Process All\n\nTime to process all these steps together to get our nice, clean data!  \n  \n\n\n  \nWell, that's all for this post now. And this was just the pre-processing I covered here. A lot more insight about your data is needed before feeding your input to a model. For this problem, you can check out the rest of the notebook [here](https://github.com/amita-shukla/nlp-economic-news/blob/master/news_relevance.ipynb), if you want to see what all I did.  \nI would also suggest going through [the NLTK book](https://www.nltk.org/book/), it helped me a lot while trying to gulp the data set down.\n",

For extracting the content of a web page, you would scrape through it, and with that, you would get a lot of gibberish along with the actual content. You might not need all of it though.  </p>\n<p>In this post, I will walk through where I applied it in my project: <a href=\"https://github.com/amita-shukla/nlp-economic-news\">Relevance of News Articles w.r.t. Economic News</a>. Given a number of news articles, the goal is to detect if that article is relevant to U.S. economy (I’m choosing U.S. because that’s the data set I got from here). This project is mainly text-heavy, so I will move ahead with discussing Natural Language Processing techniques I used.  </p>\n<p>To begin with, from all the news articles, I have chosen a random article, let’s call it <code class=\"language-text\">sample_text</code>:  </p>\n<h3>Clean HTML</h3>\n<p>The first step is to eliminate the HTML style tags. Now for this purpose, the first thought that comes up is to use regex. However, it soon got a bit complicated…<br>\nAnd then I came across <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags/1732454?stw=2#1732454\">this</a>:  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eH4h7c8eN_w/XnZ09LAtTnI/AAAAAAAAM1A/pjBimgQsWpkgl1guCDHTdU3Jh8HY_P87wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/stackoverflow_regex_parser.png\"><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eH4h7c8eN_w/XnZ09LAtTnI/AAAAAAAAM1A/pjBimgQsWpkgl1guCDHTdU3Jh8HY_P87wCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/stackoverflow_regex_parser.png\"></a></p>\n<p>And therefore, I went ahead to use the well-known python library BeautifulSoup.  </p>\n<h3>Process Single Quotes</h3>\n<p>Now as you see in the sample_text, there are a lot of special characters there. On some investigation, I observed that the pattern <code class=\"language-text\">&#39;\\x89Ûª&#39;</code> is basically the substitute of an apostrophe or a single quote. Therefore, particular to this data, I removed the pattern:  </p>\n<h3>Expand Contractions</h3>\n<p>But now the question that arises: do we want these apostrophes to processed as single words later? Suppose, if a word is <em>America’s</em>, I know that the important word here is <em>America</em> and not the apostrophe. But this might get treated as a separate word later. Therefore, I need to <strong>decontract</strong> these words, meaning I expand these words into their natural form. How to do it? Just by using simple regex replace.  </p>\n<p>Now this is not entirely accurate because I see words such as <em>he’s</em>, or <em>let’s</em>, which get transformed into <em>he is</em> and <em>let is</em> respectively. But I chose to ignore them as these words are unimportant and would get eliminated later.  </p>\n<h3>Remove Special Characters</h3>\n<p>As you see in the <code class=\"language-text\">sample_text3</code> above, there are still some special characters left that seem to add no meaning to the content of news articles. Time to extract them out.  </p>\n<h3>Trim Extra Spaces</h3>\n<p>In the above part section, I substituted the special characters with spaces <code class=\"language-text\">&#39; &#39;</code> instead of an empty string <code class=\"language-text\">&#39;&#39;</code>.  </p>\n<p>This was done after careful consideration, because some characters were actually acting as hyphens (-) and replacing hyphens with nothing resulted in two words joined together. And this would have been difficult to separate out. Hence, just trim these extra spaces.  </p>\n<h3>Tokenize words</h3>\n<p>Now that we have dealt with the processing on the complete text, we can go on now to take things word-wise. But how do we create words out of text (This is called <strong>tokenization</strong>)? It’s simple: split by space. But is it this simple? Because when we treat text as just a bunch of characters separated by spaces, we create a lot of meaning-less words when we split such a text. This is because, practically, text contains punctuation too. So if we split this text by spaces, what we get is a lot of words with punctuation attached: which for a program these are completely new words.  </p>\n<p>So what? You would say. Just remove the punctuation marks! I tried something like this:  </p>\n<p>At least for my case, this did not turn out to be that simple. Because while removing punctuation marks and then splitting the text by space sanitized my words, a lot of meaningful words got lost. e.g. <em>U.S.A.</em>: this word gets split into 3 separate words: <em>U, S, A</em>. Totally meaningless.  </p>\n<p>The Solution I derived was using the function <code class=\"language-text\">word_tokenize</code> from <code class=\"language-text\">nltk</code> library, which is more intelligent in generating such tokens.  </p>\n<p>For a term like <em>u.s.a.</em>  </p>\n<p>For our <code class=\"language-text\">sample_text</code>, these were the tokens generated. Observe that these tokens have periods and commas and other punctuation generated as separate tokens, which can be filtered as given in the code above. But <code class=\"language-text\">word_tokenize</code> from <code class=\"language-text\">nltk</code> is smart enough in not splitting all the words by punctuation, such as the phrases <em>28-year-old</em> and <em>U.S.</em> are treated as single tokens.  </p>\n<p>Obviously, this generic tokenizer is not fool-proof, as you would see some totally useless tokens generated, such as <em>years.Poland</em>. But this is a trade-off: you can either decide to handle each and every special case yourself, or give way to a bit more generalization.  </p>\n<p>What is to be done with these token you ask? Let’s move on to the next step.</p>\n<h3>Stem Text</h3>\n<p>This is an important lesson (and the most commonly used) when it comes to Natural Language Processing.</p>\n<p>When we want to process the data, we usually need to determine the count of the occurrences of a word. For example, for our problem to detect economic news for US economy, we may need to count the number of times (frequency) the words such as <em>economy</em>, <em>America</em>, <em>USA</em>, <em>dollars</em> etc occur in a given news article. But, as these articles are written in natural English, each English word may occur in a different form, such as, for <em>economy</em>different words can be <em>economic, economical, economics</em> etc. Now, these words are to be treated in the same way by our model.

While I am easily able to save history on git, I need to get back to man pages to be able to manoeuvre through the git history backwards. So I decided to jot down how to rewind your git history, and undo the changes at several stages.  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)\n\n  \nLet's go bottom-up:  \n\n\n-   [Undo git init](#git_init)\n-   [Undo unstaged work](#unstaged_work)\n-   [Undo staged work](#staged_work)\n-   -   [Difference between git rm --cached and git reset HEAD](#rm_vs_reset)\n-   [Undo commit - change commit message and other info](#commit_amend)\n-   [Undo a commit by making another commit on top of it](#commit_revert)\n-   [Undo a commit - and erase its history](#commit_erase_history)\n-   -   [Undo a commit and get back your changes back on staging area](#commit_reset_soft)\n    -   [Undo the commit and don't keep the changes](#commit_reset_hard)\n-   [Undo a commit that is not the latest one](#commit_not_latest)\n-   -   [Rebase](#rebase)\n\n### Undo git init\n\nI created a git repository inside a directory using the git init command. A git repository can be created in an empty repository or can be created with files already in it.  \n  \n\n\n    $ git init\n    Initialized empty Git repository in /home/ashukla/git_repo_demo/.git/\n\n  \nBut I decided I did not want git, or I just initialized git repo at a completely wrong place. To undo creating a git repository, you simply delete the .git repository.  \n  \n\n\n    $ rm -r .git/\n\n  \nThe .git/ directory is the git database that contains all the necessary information about the repo. Deleting the repo deletes the existence of git all altogether and your directory loses all its versioning superpower.  \n  \n\n\n### Undo unstaged work\n\nBut I hope you went ahead with git. You created some files to code on and then some work on them. But your code is like poetry, and you would rather throw it away and start afresh. You have not done anything using git on these files till now.  \n  \n\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    No commits yet\n    Untracked files:\n      (use \"git add ...\" to include in what will be committed)\n     file1\n     file2\n     file3\n    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n\n  \nAs you see above, we have 3 files which have not yet been touched by git. Git calls these files **untracked**. It simply means that these files have not yet started to be tracked by git. At this stage, anything you do with these files is not tracked by git, and cannot be reverted using git also.  \nTo delete these files, just delete these files.  \n  \n\n\n    $ rm file1 file2 file3\n\n  \n\n\nBut, at some point, you may be at a stage where some of your files are tracked, and some are not. Overall, you have added the work that was going to be committed, and only want to delete the work that was left untracked. For that, you may run the `clean` command. It is recommended that you first see what all would be deleted using -n flag and only then continue deleting:  \n  \n\n\n    $ git clean -n\n    Would remove file1\n    Would remove file2\n    Would remove file3\n\n    $ git clean -f\n    Removing file1\n    Removing file2\n    Removing file3\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    No commits yet\n\n  \n\n\n### Undo staged work\n\nSo after doing a number of deletions and additions, you finally end up with some work that is up for commit. You stage these changes by using git add command. All the work that is staged goes as a part of the next commit. At this point, note that, it has only been staged and not been commited.  \n  \n\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    No commits yet\n    Changes to be committed:\n      (use \"git rm --cached ...\" to unstage)\n     new file:   file1\n     new file:   file2\n     new file:   file3\n\n  \nBut what if some changes did not need to go to the next commit? Suppose we need to unstage file3. Git has always been helpful in suggesting the next possible steps, so here we do the same.  \n  \n\n\n    $ git rm --cached file3\n    rm 'file3'\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    No commits yet\n    Changes to be committed:\n      (use \"git rm --cached ...\" to unstage)\n     new file:   file1\n     new file:   file2\n    Untracked files:\n      (use \"git add ...\" to include in what will be committed)\n     file3\n\n  \nNote here we did what was suggested by git for us to do. There is however another suggestion that is sometimes made by git that is to do a `git reset`. So what's the difference? For that, we first need to understand what the command `git rm` does:  \n\n\n  \n\n\n_Remove files from the index, or from the working tree and the index. git rm will not remove a file from just your working directory_\n\n  \nHere working tree is the tree of committed files, and index is the staging area. In simpler terms, git rm is used to remove a file from a Git repository. It is a convenience method that combines the effect of the default shell rm command with git add . This means that it will first remove a target from the filesystem and then add that removal event to the staging index. Let's try it on terminal:  \n  \n\n\n    $ git rm file3\n    error: the following file has changes staged in the index:\n        file3\n    (use --cached to keep the file, or -f to force removal)\n\n  \nAs we have not committed anything yet, so there is no working tree. Therefore we get a warning.\n\nNow if I go via the shell `rm` command:  \n  \n\n\n    $ rm file3\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    No commits yet\n    Changes to be committed:\n      (use \"git rm --cached ...\" to unstage)\n            new file:   file1\n            new file:   file2\n            new file:   file3\n    Changes not staged for commit:\n      (use \"git add/rm ...\" to update what will be committed)\n      (use \"git checkout -- ...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n            deleted:    file3\n\n  \nAs you see above, git suggests us to record the deletion event of file3 separately by using `git add` or `git rm`  \n`\n`\n\n    $ git rm file3\n    rm 'file3'\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    No commits yet\n    Changes to be committed:\n      (use \"git rm --cached ...\" to unstage)\n            new file:   file1\n            new file:   file2\n\n  \nThis way, we have deleted the file from filesystem as well as from staging area. Please note at this point that our original intent was to just unstage the file, i.e. undo the add, and not delete the file completely. I have gone a little ahead to understand `git rm` at the first place. Now that we know `git rm`, `git rm --cached` simply means:\n\n  \n\n\n_--cached_\n\n_Use this option to unstage and remove paths only from the index. Working tree files, whether modified or not, will be left alone._\n\n  \n\n\nAll this means that by using --cached option with git rm, we only remove the file from the staging area (or index) and keep it in the file system.  \n  \n\n\n#### git rm --cached v/s git reset HEAD &lt;file>\n\nLet's move on to commit a file here:\n\n\n    $ git commit -m \"commit file1\"\n    [master (root-commit) f4585bb] commit file1\n     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n     create mode 100644 file1\n\n\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    Changes to be committed:\n      (use \"git reset HEAD ...\" to unstage)\n            new file:   file2\n\n  \n\n\nWe have committed file1 here, having left with file2. Observe git suggestion here, instead of suggesting `git rm --cached` as it did before, it now suggests `git reset HEAD`. This is because before committing anything, there was no `HEAD` commit altogether. If we had gone ahead with `git reset` at that point, we would have gotten the error: `fatal: Failed to resolve 'HEAD' as a valid ref.`  \n  \nSo why not use `git rm --cached` all the time? I actually don't know any definite answer to that, other than that if we forget `--cached` option, we might end up deleting our precious files forever.  \n  \nIn short, do what git suggests, it's probably for the best. However, we should understand what is the meaning behind its suggestions, for that reason you can bookmark this blog post!  \n  \nWe'll be moving on to commits next. Let's take some rest and revisit the commands...  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ze2SiBflkZ4/XbtF1TjELcI/AAAAAAAALL4/IDC6W-b5moU0eGu2eN60aZ4pxfXW1ybmQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/take_a_break_git.gif)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ze2SiBflkZ4/XbtF1TjELcI/AAAAAAAALL4/IDC6W-b5moU0eGu2eN60aZ4pxfXW1ybmQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/take_a_break_git.gif)\n\n  \n  \n\n\n-   Undo git init: rm -r .git/\n-   Undo unstaged/untracked files: git clean -n ; git clean -f\n-   Undo staging or unadd: git rm \\[-r] --cached &lt;file> if no commits made, else git reset HEAD &lt;file>\n\n  \n\n\n### Undo commit - change commit message and other info\n\nIn the last section, we went a little ahead and made a commit.\n\n  \n\n\n    $ git log\n    commit f4585bbdcce4ffb4c04fbac1fb0796c3ac3a2726 (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: Amita Shukla <amita.shukla0906@work.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n\n        commit file1\n\n  \nBut wait! Now that I look at it, I realize that my commit message is not very helpful, and I would rather make it more descriptive. Also, I was using my work account here, instead of using my personal account. That's a mistake and I gotta amend it. The relief is, **this commit still lies on my local computer, i.e. this commit has not been pushed and it's guaranteed that I am the only one using it.** The --amend option can help me change the commit message:  \n  \n\n\n    $ git commit --amend\n\n```\n\n```\n\nA new editor opens up. The top line is the commit message, which can be edited now:\n\n\n    commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and git reset\n    # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting\n    # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.\n    #\n    # Date:      Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n    #\n    # On branch master\n    #\n    # Initial commit\n    #\n    # Changes to be committed:\n    # new file:   file1\n    #\n    # Untracked files:\n    # file2\n    #\n\n  \n\n\nLet's move on to change the author's email address. This can be done inline as:  \n\n\n\n    $ git commit --amend --author=\"amita-shukla<amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\"\n\n\n    commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n    git reset command.\n\n    # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting\n    # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.\n    #\n    # Author:    amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    # Date:      Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n    #\n    # On branch master\n    #\n    # Initial commit\n    #\n    # Changes to be committed:\n    # new file:   file1\n    #\n    # Untracked files:\n    # file2\n    #\n\n  \nLet's have a look at out commit now:  \n\n\n\n    $ git log\n    commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n\n        commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n        git reset command.\n\nNote that by using the --amend option, we are playing with the history of your commits. The official documentation for the amend option says:  \n  \n\n\n\\--_amend_\n\n__  \n\n\n__Replace the tip of the current branch by creating a new commit. ... You should understand the implications of rewriting history if you amend a commit that has already been published.__\n\n__  \n\n\n  \n\n\nSo... there are implications. Observe that, the SHA id generated after the amend is different from the one before. So this is effectively a new commit. So as I put it on bold above, it is important that the commit you are going to commit is not shared with other people.  \n  \n\n\n### Undo a commit by making another commit\n\nTill now, we have added file1 and committed this file. Only now to realize this was a mistake and this commit should have never happened. So we need to undo the effects of the previous commit, and we want to be clear about it, by creating another commit. For this we run git revert HEAD:\n\n\n    $ git revert HEAD\n\n  \nAn editor window opens up:  \n\n\n\n    Revert \"commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and git reset\"\n    This reverts commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b.\n    # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting\n    # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.\n    # On branch master\n    # Changes to be committed:\n    # deleted:    file1\n    # Untracked files:\n    # file2\n\n  \n\n\nChecking the git and filesystem status:  \n  \n\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    Untracked files:\n      (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n            file2\n    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n\n    $ ls\n    file2\n\n  \nThe previous commit resulted in the addition of file1, and hence reverting it resulted in the deletion of file. The commit logs clearly log the commits having this:  \n  \n\n\n    $ git log\n    commit 071133e449b7dde9fced704d3bd88911440a3c62 (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 19:26:47 2019 +0530\n        Revert \"commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and git reset\"\n        This reverts commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b.\n\n    commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n        commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n        git reset command.\n\n  \n\n\n### Undo a commit - and erase its history\n\nWell, you never really erase anything in git, once you have committed it. But here you are, you have made an embarrassing mistake and so you want to undo it, without it popping up in git log.\n\n  \n\n\nLet's start with the commits we had above:\n\n  \n\n\n    $ git log\n    commit 071133e449b7dde9fced704d3bd88911440a3c62 (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 19:26:47 2019 +0530\n        Revert \"commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and git reset\"\n        This reverts commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b.\n\n    commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n        commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n        git reset command.\n\n  \n\n\nAnd suppose we want to undo the latest commit (here, this commit was deleting the file named file1). There are 2 ways of doing this:  \n  \n\n\n#### Undo the commit and get your changes back on staging area\n\nFor this we use `git reset`:  \n\n\n\n    $ git reset --soft HEAD^\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    Changes to be committed:\n      (use \"git reset HEAD <file>...\" to unstage)\n            deleted:    file1\n    Untracked files:\n      (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n            file2\n\n    $ ls\n    file2\n\n    $ git log\n    commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906 gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n\n        commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n        git reset command.\n\n  \n**`git reset --soft` puts the changes made by the commit back to staging area**. The commit that we have undone here, deleted file1. On doing soft reset, it has gotten back to staging area, and being shown as deleted. The file system doesn't contain the file, because, as said earlier it was deleted. The `git log` only shows the previous commit now.  \n  \n\n\n#### Undo the commit and don't keep the changes\n\nFor this we use `git reset --hard`. Back to the state where we have to undo the latest commit:\n\n  \n\n\n    $ git reset --hard HEAD^\n    HEAD is now at 76ee43a commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    Untracked files:\n      (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n            file2\n    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n\n    $ ls\n    file1  file2\n\n    $ git log\n    commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906 gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n        commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n        git reset command.\n\n  \n\n\nAs can be seen in the above snippet, on doing hard reset, we lose the changes made by the commit at all. So, we should use hard reset when we don't want changes done by the commit lurking around. So in our case, the commit performed the action of deletion, therefore on doing hard reset, file1 is back as a committed file, back in the filesystem, and the commit disappears from the log.  \n  \nObserve a small difference here in the syntax between reset and revert. We **write revert command as `git revert HEAD` but reset as `git reset HEAD^`**. So if you have to undo the `HEAD` commit, for revert you supply the last commit, but for reset you supply the one before the last commit. This is because `git reset` resets the commit to the supplied state.  \n  \n\n\n### Undo not the latest commit\n\nWe have been trying to rever the latest commit, denoted by HEAD. But what if we made a misguided commit, and then went on to do a series of commits? How to pick one commit from middle and revert those changes?\n\nWe can go with git revert. As described in the last section, git revert picks up the changes made by the commit, and reverts those changes into a new commit.\n\nOr we call out the mighty rebase...\n\n  \n\n\n#### Rebase\n\nSuppose we have the following 4 commits and I need to revert the commit with SHA ending with a6db3e (the 3rd commit):  \n  \n\n\n    $ git log\n    commit 12ba23fd90a161b7762c82a6127bb9eecb0853ce (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Sat Nov 2 22:32:34 2019 +0530\n        create file4\n\n    commit 0753b7231a33deba65afbbb0f364161bfea6db3e\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Sat Nov 2 22:32:03 2019 +0530\n        create file3\n\n    commit c4a38cb0b16d97cc60280d162a89576a3a153811\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Sat Nov 2 22:29:47 2019 +0530\n        create file2\n\n    commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n        commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n        git reset command.\n\n  \n Execute the rebase command for a commit before:  \n  \n\n\n    $ git rebase -i c4a38cb0b16d97cc60280d162a89576a3a153811\n\n  \n\n\nThis opens up an editor like this:  \n\n\n\n    pick 0753b72 create file3\n    pick 12ba23f create file4\n\n    # Rebase c4a38cb..12ba23f onto c4a38cb (2 commands)\n    #\n    # Commands:\n    # p, pick = use commit\n    # r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message\n    # e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending\n    # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit\n    # f, fixup = like \"squash\", but discard this commit's log message\n    # x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell\n    # d, drop = remove commit\n    #\n    # These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.\n    #\n    # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.\n    #\n    # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.\n    #\n    # Note that empty commits are commented out\n\n  \nTo delete the commit \"create file3\", we simply delete that line altogether. Save and quit the file. The logs now show up as:  \n  \n\n\n    $ git log\n    commit 7a79af7ddbfb2ddba4624f63bed36ea89f4edfd7 (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Sat Nov 2 22:32:34 2019 +0530\n        create file4\n\n    commit c4a38cb0b16d97cc60280d162a89576a3a153811\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Sat Nov 2 22:29:47 2019 +0530\n        create file2\n\n    commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n        commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n        git reset command.\n\n\n    $ ls\n    file1  file2  file4\n\n  \nAs we can see above, the commit doesn't exist anymore, and also no file3 exists in the filesystem. Remember, I called the rebase 'mighty' for this reason. If not careful, rebase changes history and you may lose your work. Rebase is like a swiss knife for git, and comes with a lot of powerful features (as listed in the editor window that opens up during interactive rebase), which if we discuss here may take this post off track.  \n  \nIn this post, I have tried to put up all the undo steps that we may need on our local system, and for a single branch. A lot more is possible beyond the above list, and I will try to cover that in the next post.  \n  \n\n",

You have not done anything using git on these files till now.  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git status\nOn branch master\nNo commits yet\nUntracked files:\n  (use &quot;git add ...&quot; to include in what will be committed)\n file1\n file2\n file3\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)</code></pre></div>\n<p>As you see above, we have 3 files which have not yet been touched by git. Git calls these files <strong>untracked</strong>. It simply means that these files have not yet started to be tracked by git. At this stage, anything you do with these files is not tracked by git, and cannot be reverted using git also.<br>\nTo delete these files, just delete these files.  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ rm file1 file2 file3</code></pre></div>\n<p>But, at some point, you may be at a stage where some of your files are tracked, and some are not. Overall, you have added the work that was going to be committed, and only want to delete the work that was left untracked. For that, you may run the <code class=\"language-text\">clean</code> command. It is recommended that you first see what all would be deleted using -n flag and only then continue deleting:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git clean -n\nWould remove file1\nWould remove file2\nWould remove file3\n\n$ git clean -f\nRemoving file1\nRemoving file2\nRemoving file3\n\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nNo commits yet</code></pre></div>\n<h3>Undo staged work</h3>\n<p>So after doing a number of deletions and additions, you finally end up with some work that is up for commit. You stage these changes by using git add command. All the work that is staged goes as a part of the next commit. At this point, note that, it has only been staged and not been commited.  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git status\nOn branch master\nNo commits yet\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use &quot;git rm --cached ...&quot; to unstage)\n new file:   file1\n new file:   file2\n new file:   file3</code></pre></div>\n<p>But what if some changes did not need to go to the next commit? Suppose we need to unstage file3. Git has always been helpful in suggesting the next possible steps, so here we do the same.  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git rm --cached file3\nrm &#39;file3&#39;\n\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nNo commits yet\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use &quot;git rm --cached ...&quot; to unstage)\n new file:   file1\n new file:   file2\nUntracked files:\n  (use &quot;git add ...&quot; to include in what will be committed)\n file3</code></pre></div>\n<p>Note here we did what was suggested by git for us to do. There is however another suggestion that is sometimes made by git that is to do a <code class=\"language-text\">git reset</code>. So what’s the difference? For that, we first need to understand what the command <code class=\"language-text\">git rm</code> does:  </p>\n<p><em>Remove files from the index, or from the working tree and the index. git rm will not remove a file from just your working directory</em></p>\n<p>Here working tree is the tree of committed files, and index is the staging area. In simpler terms, git rm is used to remove a file from a Git repository. It is a convenience method that combines the effect of the default shell rm command with git add . This means that it will first remove a target from the filesystem and then add that removal event to the staging index. Let’s try it on terminal:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git rm file3\nerror: the following file has changes staged in the index:\n    file3\n(use --cached to keep the file, or -f to force removal)</code></pre></div>\n<p>As we have not committed anything yet, so there is no working tree. Therefore we get a warning.</p>\n<p>Now if I go via the shell <code class=\"language-text\">rm</code> command:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ rm file3\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nNo commits yet\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use &quot;git rm --cached ...&quot; to unstage)\n        new file:   file1\n        new file:   file2\n        new file:   file3\nChanges not staged for commit:\n  (use &quot;git add/rm ...&quot; to update what will be committed)\n  (use &quot;git checkout -- ...&quot; to discard changes in working directory)\n        deleted:    file3</code></pre></div>\n<p>As you see above, git suggests us to record the deletion event of file3 separately by using <code class=\"language-text\">git add</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">git rm</code><br>\n<code class=\"language-text\"></code></p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git rm file3\nrm &#39;file3&#39;\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nNo commits yet\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use &quot;git rm --cached ...&quot; to unstage)\n        new file:   file1\n        new file:   file2</code></pre></div>\n<p>This way, we have deleted the file from filesystem as well as from staging area. Please note at this point that our original intent was to just unstage the file, i.e. undo the add, and not delete the file completely. I have gone a little ahead to understand <code class=\"language-text\">git rm</code> at the first place. Now that we know <code class=\"language-text\">git rm</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">git rm --cached</code> simply means:</p>\n<p><em>—cached</em></p>\n<p><em>Use this option to unstage and remove paths only from the index. Working tree files, whether modified or not, will be left alone.</em></p>\n<p>All this means that by using —cached option with git rm, we only remove the file from the staging area (or index) and keep it in the file system.  </p>\n<h4>git rm —cached v/s git reset HEAD &#x3C;file></h4>\n<p>Let’s move on to commit a file here:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git commit -m &quot;commit file1&quot;\n[master (root-commit) f4585bb] commit file1\n 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n create mode 100644 file1\n\n\n\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use &quot;git reset HEAD ...&quot; to unstage)\n        new file:   file2</code></pre></div>\n<p>We have committed file1 here, having left with file2. Observe git suggestion here, instead of suggesting <code class=\"language-text\">git rm --cached</code> as it did before, it now suggests <code class=\"language-text\">git reset HEAD</code>. This is because before committing anything, there was no <code class=\"language-text\">HEAD</code> commit altogether. If we had gone ahead with <code class=\"language-text\">git reset</code> at that point, we would have gotten the error: <code class=\"language-text\">fatal: Failed to resolve &#39;HEAD&#39; as a valid ref.</code>  </p>\n<p>So why not use <code class=\"language-text\">git rm --cached</code> all the time? I actually don’t know any definite answer to that, other than that if we forget <code class=\"language-text\">--cached</code> option, we might end up deleting our precious files forever.  </p>\n<p>In short, do what git suggests, it’s probably for the best. However, we should understand what is the meaning behind its suggestions, for that reason you can bookmark this blog post!  </p>\n<p>We’ll be moving on to commits next. Let’s take some rest and revisit the commands…  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ze2SiBflkZ4/XbtF1TjELcI/AAAAAAAALL4/IDC6W-b5moU0eGu2eN60aZ4pxfXW1ybmQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/take_a_break_git.gif\"><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ze2SiBflkZ4/XbtF1TjELcI/AAAAAAAALL4/IDC6W-b5moU0eGu2eN60aZ4pxfXW1ybmQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/take_a_break_git.gif\"></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Undo git init: rm -r .git/</li>\n<li>Undo unstaged/untracked files: git clean -n ; git clean -f</li>\n<li>Undo staging or unadd: git rm [-r] —cached &#x3C;file> if no commits made, else git reset HEAD &#x3C;file></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Undo commit - change commit message and other info</h3>\n<p>In the last section, we went a little ahead and made a commit.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git log\ncommit f4585bbdcce4ffb4c04fbac1fb0796c3ac3a2726 (HEAD -&gt; master)\nAuthor: Amita Shukla &lt;amita.shukla0906@work.com&gt;\nDate:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n\n    commit file1</code></pre></div>\n<p>But wait!

Observe that, the SHA id generated after the amend is different from the one before. So this is effectively a new commit. So as I put it on bold above, it is important that the commit you are going to commit is not shared with other people.  </p>\n<h3>Undo a commit by making another commit</h3>\n<p>Till now, we have added file1 and committed this file. Only now to realize this was a mistake and this commit should have never happened. So we need to undo the effects of the previous commit, and we want to be clear about it, by creating another commit. For this we run git revert HEAD:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git revert HEAD</code></pre></div>\n<p>An editor window opens up:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Revert &quot;commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and git reset&quot;\nThis reverts commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b.\n# Please enter the commit message for your changes.

But here you are, you have made an embarrassing mistake and so you want to undo it, without it popping up in git log.</p>\n<p>Let’s start with the commits we had above:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git log\ncommit 071133e449b7dde9fced704d3bd88911440a3c62 (HEAD -&gt; master)\nAuthor: amita-shukla &lt;amitashukla0906@gmail.com&gt;\nDate:   Fri Nov 1 19:26:47 2019 +0530\n    Revert &quot;commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and git reset&quot;\n    This reverts commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b.\n\ncommit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b\nAuthor: amita-shukla &lt;amitashukla0906@gmail.com&gt;\nDate:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n    commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n    git reset command.</code></pre></div>\n<p>And suppose we want to undo the latest commit (here, this commit was deleting the file named file1). There are 2 ways of doing this:  </p>\n<h4>Undo the commit and get your changes back on staging area</h4>\n<p>For this we use <code class=\"language-text\">git reset</code>:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git reset --soft HEAD^\n\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nChanges to be committed:\n  (use &quot;git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)\n        deleted:    file1\nUntracked files:\n  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)\n        file2\n\n$ ls\nfile2\n\n$ git log\ncommit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b (HEAD -&gt; master)\nAuthor: amita-shukla &lt;amitashukla0906 gmail.com&gt;\nDate:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n\n    commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n    git reset command.</code></pre></div>\n<p><strong><code class=\"language-text\">git reset --soft</code> puts the changes made by the commit back to staging area</strong>. The commit that we have undone here, deleted file1. On doing soft reset, it has gotten back to staging area, and being shown as deleted. The file system doesn’t contain the file, because, as said earlier it was deleted. The <code class=\"language-text\">git log</code> only shows the previous commit now.  </p>\n<h4>Undo the commit and don’t keep the changes</h4>\n<p>For this we use <code class=\"language-text\">git reset --hard</code>. Back to the state where we have to undo the latest commit:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git reset --hard HEAD^\nHEAD is now at 76ee43a commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n\n$ git status\nOn branch master\nUntracked files:\n  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)\n        file2\nnothing added to commit but untracked files present (use &quot;git add&quot; to track)\n\n$ ls\nfile1  file2\n\n$ git log\ncommit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b (HEAD -&gt; master)\nAuthor: amita-shukla &lt;amitashukla0906 gmail.com&gt;\nDate:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n    commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n    git reset command.</code></pre></div>\n<p>As can be seen in the above snippet, on doing hard reset, we lose the changes made by the commit at all. So, we should use hard reset when we don’t want changes done by the commit lurking around. So in our case, the commit performed the action of deletion, therefore on doing hard reset, file1 is back as a committed file, back in the filesystem, and the commit disappears from the log.  </p>\n<p>Observe a small difference here in the syntax between reset and revert. We <strong>write revert command as <code class=\"language-text\">git revert HEAD</code> but reset as <code class=\"language-text\">git reset HEAD^</code></strong>. So if you have to undo the <code class=\"language-text\">HEAD</code> commit, for revert you supply the last commit, but for reset you supply the one before the last commit. This is because <code class=\"language-text\">git reset</code> resets the commit to the supplied state.  </p>\n<h3>Undo not the latest commit</h3>\n<p>We have been trying to rever the latest commit, denoted by HEAD. But what if we made a misguided commit, and then went on to do a series of commits? How to pick one commit from middle and revert those changes?</p>\n<p>We can go with git revert. As described in the last section, git revert picks up the changes made by the commit, and reverts those changes into a new commit.</p>\n<p>Or we call out the mighty rebase…</p>\n<h4>Rebase</h4>\n<p>Suppose we have the following 4 commits and I need to revert the commit with SHA ending with a6db3e (the 3rd commit):  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git log\ncommit 12ba23fd90a161b7762c82a6127bb9eecb0853ce (HEAD -&gt; master)\nAuthor: amita-shukla &lt;amitashukla0906@gmail.com&gt;\nDate:   Sat Nov 2 22:32:34 2019 +0530\n    create file4\n\ncommit 0753b7231a33deba65afbbb0f364161bfea6db3e\nAuthor: amita-shukla &lt;amitashukla0906@gmail.com&gt;\nDate:   Sat Nov 2 22:32:03 2019 +0530\n    create file3\n\ncommit c4a38cb0b16d97cc60280d162a89576a3a153811\nAuthor: amita-shukla &lt;amitashukla0906@gmail.com&gt;\nDate:   Sat Nov 2 22:29:47 2019 +0530\n    create file2\n\ncommit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b\nAuthor: amita-shukla &lt;amitashukla0906@gmail.com&gt;\nDate:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n    commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n    git reset command.</code></pre></div>\n<p> Execute the rebase command for a commit before:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">$ git rebase -i c4a38cb0b16d97cc60280d162a89576a3a153811</code></pre></div>\n<p>This opens up an editor like this:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">pick 0753b72 create file3\npick 12ba23f create file4\n\n# Rebase c4a38cb..12ba23f onto c4a38cb (2 commands)\n#\n# Commands:\n# p, pick = use commit\n# r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message\n# e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending\n# s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit\n# f, fixup = like &quot;squash&quot;, but discard this commit&#39;s log message\n# x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell\n# d, drop = remove commit\n#\n# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.\n#\n# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.\n#\n# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.\n#\n# Note that empty commits are commented out</code></pre></div>\n<p>To delete the commit “create file3”, we simply delete that line altogether.

So I decided to jot down how to rewind your git history, and undo the changes at several stages.  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/git.png)\n\n  \nLet's go bottom-up:  \n\n\n-   [Undo git init](#git_init)\n-   [Undo unstaged work](#unstaged_work)\n-   [Undo staged work](#staged_work)\n-   -   [Difference between git rm --cached and git reset HEAD](#rm_vs_reset)\n-   [Undo commit - change commit message and other info](#commit_amend)\n-   [Undo a commit by making another commit on top of it](#commit_revert)\n-   [Undo a commit - and erase its history](#commit_erase_history)\n-   -   [Undo a commit and get back your changes back on staging area](#commit_reset_soft)\n    -   [Undo the commit and don't keep the changes](#commit_reset_hard)\n-   [Undo a commit that is not the latest one](#commit_not_latest)\n-   -   [Rebase](#rebase)\n\n### Undo git init\n\nI created a git repository inside a directory using the git init command. A git repository can be created in an empty repository or can be created with files already in it.  \n  \n\n\n    $ git init\n    Initialized empty Git repository in /home/ashukla/git_repo_demo/.git/\n\n  \nBut I decided I did not want git, or I just initialized git repo at a completely wrong place. To undo creating a git repository, you simply delete the .git repository.  \n  \n\n\n    $ rm -r .git/\n\n  \nThe .git/ directory is the git database that contains all the necessary information about the repo. Deleting the repo deletes the existence of git all altogether and your directory loses all its versioning superpower.  \n  \n\n\n### Undo unstaged work\n\nBut I hope you went ahead with git. You created some files to code on and then some work on them. But your code is like poetry, and you would rather throw it away and start afresh. You have not done anything using git on these files till now.  \n  \n\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    No commits yet\n    Untracked files:\n      (use \"git add ...\" to include in what will be committed)\n     file1\n     file2\n     file3\n    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n\n  \nAs you see above, we have 3 files which have not yet been touched by git. Git calls these files **untracked**. It simply means that these files have not yet started to be tracked by git. At this stage, anything you do with these files is not tracked by git, and cannot be reverted using git also.  \nTo delete these files, just delete these files.  \n  \n\n\n    $ rm file1 file2 file3\n\n  \n\n\nBut, at some point, you may be at a stage where some of your files are tracked, and some are not. Overall, you have added the work that was going to be committed, and only want to delete the work that was left untracked. For that, you may run the `clean` command. It is recommended that you first see what all would be deleted using -n flag and only then continue deleting:  \n  \n\n\n    $ git clean -n\n    Would remove file1\n    Would remove file2\n    Would remove file3\n\n    $ git clean -f\n    Removing file1\n    Removing file2\n    Removing file3\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    No commits yet\n\n  \n\n\n### Undo staged work\n\nSo after doing a number of deletions and additions, you finally end up with some work that is up for commit. You stage these changes by using git add command. All the work that is staged goes as a part of the next commit. At this point, note that, it has only been staged and not been commited.  \n  \n\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    No commits yet\n    Changes to be committed:\n      (use \"git rm --cached ...\" to unstage)\n     new file:   file1\n     new file:   file2\n     new file:   file3\n\n  \nBut what if some changes did not need to go to the next commit? Suppose we need to unstage file3. Git has always been helpful in suggesting the next possible steps, so here we do the same.  \n  \n\n\n    $ git rm --cached file3\n    rm 'file3'\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    No commits yet\n    Changes to be committed:\n      (use \"git rm --cached ...\" to unstage)\n     new file:   file1\n     new file:   file2\n    Untracked files:\n      (use \"git add ...\" to include in what will be committed)\n     file3\n\n  \nNote here we did what was suggested by git for us to do. There is however another suggestion that is sometimes made by git that is to do a `git reset`. So what's the difference? For that, we first need to understand what the command `git rm` does:  \n\n\n  \n\n\n_Remove files from the index, or from the working tree and the index. git rm will not remove a file from just your working directory_\n\n  \nHere working tree is the tree of committed files, and index is the staging area. In simpler terms, git rm is used to remove a file from a Git repository. It is a convenience method that combines the effect of the default shell rm command with git add . This means that it will first remove a target from the filesystem and then add that removal event to the staging index. Let's try it on terminal:  \n  \n\n\n    $ git rm file3\n    error: the following file has changes staged in the index:\n        file3\n    (use --cached to keep the file, or -f to force removal)\n\n  \nAs we have not committed anything yet, so there is no working tree. Therefore we get a warning.\n\nNow if I go via the shell `rm` command:  \n  \n\n\n    $ rm file3\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    No commits yet\n    Changes to be committed:\n      (use \"git rm --cached ...\" to unstage)\n            new file:   file1\n            new file:   file2\n            new file:   file3\n    Changes not staged for commit:\n      (use \"git add/rm ...\" to update what will be committed)\n      (use \"git checkout -- ...\" to discard changes in working directory)\n            deleted:    file3\n\n  \nAs you see above, git suggests us to record the deletion event of file3 separately by using `git add` or `git rm`  \n`\n`\n\n    $ git rm file3\n    rm 'file3'\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    No commits yet\n    Changes to be committed:\n      (use \"git rm --cached ...\" to unstage)\n            new file:   file1\n            new file:   file2\n\n  \nThis way, we have deleted the file from filesystem as well as from staging area. Please note at this point that our original intent was to just unstage the file, i.e. undo the add, and not delete the file completely. I have gone a little ahead to understand `git rm` at the first place. Now that we know `git rm`, `git rm --cached` simply means:\n\n  \n\n\n_--cached_\n\n_Use this option to unstage and remove paths only from the index. Working tree files, whether modified or not, will be left alone._\n\n  \n\n\nAll this means that by using --cached option with git rm, we only remove the file from the staging area (or index) and keep it in the file system.  \n  \n\n\n#### git rm --cached v/s git reset HEAD &lt;file>\n\nLet's move on to commit a file here:\n\n\n    $ git commit -m \"commit file1\"\n    [master (root-commit) f4585bb] commit file1\n     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)\n     create mode 100644 file1\n\n\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    Changes to be committed:\n      (use \"git reset HEAD ...\" to unstage)\n            new file:   file2\n\n  \n\n\nWe have committed file1 here, having left with file2. Observe git suggestion here, instead of suggesting `git rm --cached` as it did before, it now suggests `git reset HEAD`. This is because before committing anything, there was no `HEAD` commit altogether. If we had gone ahead with `git reset` at that point, we would have gotten the error: `fatal: Failed to resolve 'HEAD' as a valid ref.`  \n  \nSo why not use `git rm --cached` all the time? I actually don't know any definite answer to that, other than that if we forget `--cached` option, we might end up deleting our precious files forever.  \n  \nIn short, do what git suggests, it's probably for the best. However, we should understand what is the meaning behind its suggestions, for that reason you can bookmark this blog post!  \n  \nWe'll be moving on to commits next. Let's take some rest and revisit the commands...  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ze2SiBflkZ4/XbtF1TjELcI/AAAAAAAALL4/IDC6W-b5moU0eGu2eN60aZ4pxfXW1ybmQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/take_a_break_git.gif)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ze2SiBflkZ4/XbtF1TjELcI/AAAAAAAALL4/IDC6W-b5moU0eGu2eN60aZ4pxfXW1ybmQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/take_a_break_git.gif)\n\n  \n  \n\n\n-   Undo git init: rm -r .git/\n-   Undo unstaged/untracked files: git clean -n ; git clean -f\n-   Undo staging or unadd: git rm \\[-r] --cached &lt;file> if no commits made, else git reset HEAD &lt;file>\n\n  \n\n\n### Undo commit - change commit message and other info\n\nIn the last section, we went a little ahead and made a commit.\n\n  \n\n\n    $ git log\n    commit f4585bbdcce4ffb4c04fbac1fb0796c3ac3a2726 (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: Amita Shukla <amita.shukla0906@work.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n\n        commit file1\n\n  \nBut wait! Now that I look at it, I realize that my commit message is not very helpful, and I would rather make it more descriptive. Also, I was using my work account here, instead of using my personal account. That's a mistake and I gotta amend it. The relief is, **this commit still lies on my local computer, i.e. this commit has not been pushed and it's guaranteed that I am the only one using it.** The --amend option can help me change the commit message:  \n  \n\n\n    $ git commit --amend\n\n```\n\n```\n\nA new editor opens up. The top line is the commit message, which can be edited now:\n\n\n    commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and git reset\n    # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting\n    # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.\n    #\n    # Date:      Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n    #\n    # On branch master\n    #\n    # Initial commit\n    #\n    # Changes to be committed:\n    # new file:   file1\n    #\n    # Untracked files:\n    # file2\n    #\n\n  \n\n\nLet's move on to change the author's email address. This can be done inline as:  \n\n\n\n    $ git commit --amend --author=\"amita-shukla<amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\"\n\n\n    commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n    git reset command.\n\n    # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting\n    # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.\n    #\n    # Author:    amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    # Date:      Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n    #\n    # On branch master\n    #\n    # Initial commit\n    #\n    # Changes to be committed:\n    # new file:   file1\n    #\n    # Untracked files:\n    # file2\n    #\n\n  \nLet's have a look at out commit now:  \n\n\n\n    $ git log\n    commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n\n        commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n        git reset command.\n\nNote that by using the --amend option, we are playing with the history of your commits. The official documentation for the amend option says:  \n  \n\n\n\\--_amend_\n\n__  \n\n\n__Replace the tip of the current branch by creating a new commit. ... You should understand the implications of rewriting history if you amend a commit that has already been published.__\n\n__  \n\n\n  \n\n\nSo... there are implications. Observe that, the SHA id generated after the amend is different from the one before. So this is effectively a new commit. So as I put it on bold above, it is important that the commit you are going to commit is not shared with other people.  \n  \n\n\n### Undo a commit by making another commit\n\nTill now, we have added file1 and committed this file. Only now to realize this was a mistake and this commit should have never happened. So we need to undo the effects of the previous commit, and we want to be clear about it, by creating another commit. For this we run git revert HEAD:\n\n\n    $ git revert HEAD\n\n  \nAn editor window opens up:  \n\n\n\n    Revert \"commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and git reset\"\n    This reverts commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b.\n    # Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting\n    # with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.\n    # On branch master\n    # Changes to be committed:\n    # deleted:    file1\n    # Untracked files:\n    # file2\n\n  \n\n\nChecking the git and filesystem status:  \n  \n\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    Untracked files:\n      (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n            file2\n    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n\n    $ ls\n    file2\n\n  \nThe previous commit resulted in the addition of file1, and hence reverting it resulted in the deletion of file. The commit logs clearly log the commits having this:  \n  \n\n\n    $ git log\n    commit 071133e449b7dde9fced704d3bd88911440a3c62 (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 19:26:47 2019 +0530\n        Revert \"commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and git reset\"\n        This reverts commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b.\n\n    commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n        commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n        git reset command.\n\n  \n\n\n### Undo a commit - and erase its history\n\nWell, you never really erase anything in git, once you have committed it. But here you are, you have made an embarrassing mistake and so you want to undo it, without it popping up in git log.\n\n  \n\n\nLet's start with the commits we had above:\n\n  \n\n\n    $ git log\n    commit 071133e449b7dde9fced704d3bd88911440a3c62 (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 19:26:47 2019 +0530\n        Revert \"commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and git reset\"\n        This reverts commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b.\n\n    commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n        commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n        git reset command.\n\n  \n\n\nAnd suppose we want to undo the latest commit (here, this commit was deleting the file named file1). There are 2 ways of doing this:  \n  \n\n\n#### Undo the commit and get your changes back on staging area\n\nFor this we use `git reset`:  \n\n\n\n    $ git reset --soft HEAD^\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    Changes to be committed:\n      (use \"git reset HEAD <file>...\" to unstage)\n            deleted:    file1\n    Untracked files:\n      (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n            file2\n\n    $ ls\n    file2\n\n    $ git log\n    commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906 gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n\n        commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n        git reset command.\n\n  \n**`git reset --soft` puts the changes made by the commit back to staging area**. The commit that we have undone here, deleted file1. On doing soft reset, it has gotten back to staging area, and being shown as deleted. The file system doesn't contain the file, because, as said earlier it was deleted. The `git log` only shows the previous commit now.  \n  \n\n\n#### Undo the commit and don't keep the changes\n\nFor this we use `git reset --hard`. Back to the state where we have to undo the latest commit:\n\n  \n\n\n    $ git reset --hard HEAD^\n    HEAD is now at 76ee43a commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n\n    $ git status\n    On branch master\n    Untracked files:\n      (use \"git add <file>...\" to include in what will be committed)\n            file2\n    nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use \"git add\" to track)\n\n    $ ls\n    file1  file2\n\n    $ git log\n    commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906 gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n        commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n        git reset command.\n\n  \n\n\nAs can be seen in the above snippet, on doing hard reset, we lose the changes made by the commit at all. So, we should use hard reset when we don't want changes done by the commit lurking around. So in our case, the commit performed the action of deletion, therefore on doing hard reset, file1 is back as a committed file, back in the filesystem, and the commit disappears from the log.  \n  \nObserve a small difference here in the syntax between reset and revert. We **write revert command as `git revert HEAD` but reset as `git reset HEAD^`**. So if you have to undo the `HEAD` commit, for revert you supply the last commit, but for reset you supply the one before the last commit. This is because `git reset` resets the commit to the supplied state.  \n  \n\n\n### Undo not the latest commit\n\nWe have been trying to rever the latest commit, denoted by HEAD. But what if we made a misguided commit, and then went on to do a series of commits? How to pick one commit from middle and revert those changes?\n\nWe can go with git revert. As described in the last section, git revert picks up the changes made by the commit, and reverts those changes into a new commit.\n\nOr we call out the mighty rebase...\n\n  \n\n\n#### Rebase\n\nSuppose we have the following 4 commits and I need to revert the commit with SHA ending with a6db3e (the 3rd commit):  \n  \n\n\n    $ git log\n    commit 12ba23fd90a161b7762c82a6127bb9eecb0853ce (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Sat Nov 2 22:32:34 2019 +0530\n        create file4\n\n    commit 0753b7231a33deba65afbbb0f364161bfea6db3e\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Sat Nov 2 22:32:03 2019 +0530\n        create file3\n\n    commit c4a38cb0b16d97cc60280d162a89576a3a153811\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Sat Nov 2 22:29:47 2019 +0530\n        create file2\n\n    commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n        commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n        git reset command.\n\n  \n Execute the rebase command for a commit before:  \n  \n\n\n    $ git rebase -i c4a38cb0b16d97cc60280d162a89576a3a153811\n\n  \n\n\nThis opens up an editor like this:  \n\n\n\n    pick 0753b72 create file3\n    pick 12ba23f create file4\n\n    # Rebase c4a38cb..12ba23f onto c4a38cb (2 commands)\n    #\n    # Commands:\n    # p, pick = use commit\n    # r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message\n    # e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending\n    # s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit\n    # f, fixup = like \"squash\", but discard this commit's log message\n    # x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell\n    # d, drop = remove commit\n    #\n    # These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.\n    #\n    # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.\n    #\n    # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.\n    #\n    # Note that empty commits are commented out\n\n  \nTo delete the commit \"create file3\", we simply delete that line altogether. Save and quit the file. The logs now show up as:  \n  \n\n\n    $ git log\n    commit 7a79af7ddbfb2ddba4624f63bed36ea89f4edfd7 (HEAD -> master)\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Sat Nov 2 22:32:34 2019 +0530\n        create file4\n\n    commit c4a38cb0b16d97cc60280d162a89576a3a153811\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Sat Nov 2 22:29:47 2019 +0530\n        create file2\n\n    commit 76ee43a95a3b56f7890c8d54e82ea931b916136b\n    Author: amita-shukla <amitashukla0906@gmail.com>\n    Date:   Fri Nov 1 00:14:37 2019 +0530\n        commit file1 to demonstrate the difference between git rm --cached and\n        git reset command.\n\n\n    $ ls\n    file1  file2  file4\n\n  \nAs we can see above, the commit doesn't exist anymore, and also no file3 exists in the filesystem. Remember, I called the rebase 'mighty' for this reason. If not careful, rebase changes history and you may lose your work. Rebase is like a swiss knife for git, and comes with a lot of powerful features (as listed in the editor window that opens up during interactive rebase), which if we discuss here may take this post off track.  \n  \nIn this post, I have tried to put up all the undo steps that we may need on our local system, and for a single branch. A lot more is possible beyond the above list, and I will try to cover that in the next post.  \n  \n\n"

However, as I went deeper into more and more code written by Scala devs out there, there were a lot of things I just could not wrap my head around. Wait! This is not going to be a rant on the language. Instead, I will be touching upon the most basic stuff today - **declaring, initializing variables** (let's call them 'variable', though they may not necessarily vary) and **evaluating expressions**.  \n  \nThere are painfully a lot of different ways to declare stuff in Scala, along with the regular `var` and `val`.

The only place where it can be left undefined is when it is declared inside an abstract class or trait:\n\n  \n\n\n### `val`s, that can't vary\n\n-   `val`s are absolute values, which once assigned cannot be changed/reassigned at any point of time in the program.\n-   Like `var`s, `val`s cannot be left undefined outside of an abstract class or trait. But this is kind of obvious here, for something that cannot be changed later must not be left uninitialized.\n\n`val` should be the goto way of using variables, as it helps to **design immutable structures**. While there can be a lot written about immutable data structures, in short we can say that by using immutable values we can avoid the risk of changing them later unintentionally.\n\n  \n\n\n### Define a variable with `def`\n\nWe can also write a variable using `def`:\n\nObserve here, the REPL doesn't indicate the value of `x`, it just calls out that it has registered `x` with itself. Only when I call this _function `x`_ in the next step, that the execution happens. This is unlike what we have seen for `var` and `val`, where the REPL clearly indicates that it is storing an identifier `x` with a value `42`.  \n\n\nI had seen this style being used in a lot of places, and I found it weird. Why define a variable the way we define a function? When I can write something as `val x = 42`, what difference it makes if I write the statement as `def x = 42` ? Both can be invoked in the same way also:\n\n  \n\n\nThis is because **Scala differentiates between functions and methods**. The 'functions' we are calling out by using `def` is technically not a function but a method. Defining using `val` gives us the function in real sense in Scala.  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l4lUeMRIY2M/XadmgbFuDVI/AAAAAAAALA0/qUGzB2tcbGscuPR4RCXiGGwbjKYkFO9ZwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/scala_meme.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l4lUeMRIY2M/XadmgbFuDVI/AAAAAAAALA0/qUGzB2tcbGscuPR4RCXiGGwbjKYkFO9ZwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/scala_meme.jpg)\n\n  \n  \n\n\n#### Functions v/s Methods\n\nLet's divert briefly to understand the spaghetti that functions and methods are:  \n\n\n-   Functions in scala are instances of `Function0` - `Function22` class, and `Function` class contains methods such as `apply`, `toString`, `compose`, `andThen`. Hence, these functions can be applied on values defined using `val`.\n-   Methods in scala are a part of a class, just like a method in Java. These methods have access to other members of the same class. Methods also contain an implicit reference to `this`. And that is why we can call `map` on `List` (`map` has access to the instance of `List` it has been called upon).\n-   Hence, when we want certain behaviours as a part of a class, we define methods on that class, and for all other purposes, we use functions.\n\nLet's come back to where we left. In terms of evaluation, one difference there is: a value defined using `val` is evaluated at the very point, whereas, a value defined using a `def` is evaluated only when it is called.\n\n  \n\n\nHere, that I have added a print statement at the time of definition. Observe that, `val x` is evaluated immediately at the time of definition, and is never evaluated ever again. On the other hand, `def y` is not evaluated at the time of definition but is rather delayed till its invocation. However, it is evaluated again each time `y` is used (This is synonymous with what is expected from a function).\n\nWhile delaying execution till the time may be loosely termed as _lazy_, but this is not entirely lazy, as the execution happens every time the value is used.\n\n### Make a value lazy with lazy val\n\nIn scala, a value can be made explicitly lazy using the keyword `lazy` before declaring a `val`. This means:  \n\n\n-   The value is not evaluated till its first use,\n-   The evaluated result is then stored and reused whenever the value is used later.\n-   If in a program, a `lazy val` is defined but never used, it is never evaluated.\n-   Lazy `val`s can be used to implement **memoization** technique.\n\nThe above snippet first shows the simple case, just add the keyword `lazy` with `val` to make a word lazy. In the next case, we add a print statement to show when is the actual execution is taking place. Observe here that \"y is executed\" is printed only when the `y` is used for the first time.  \n  \n\n\n#### A small exercise\n\nLet's go through a small exercise that I found as a part of [Functional Programming Design in Scala course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2?specialization=scala), that may help to realize some of the above differences discussed above.  \nWhat should be the result of `println(expr)`?  \n  \nLet's summarize how `val`, `lazy val` and `def` works here:  \n\n\n-   `val` evaluates the expression on initialization and stores the value with itself. Hence `print(\"x\")` occurs just the first time `val x` it is initialized.\n-   `lazy val` does not evaluate the expression when initialized. Rather, it evaluates when it is first used, and then stores the value with itself. Hence, `print(\"y\")` occurs not when it is initialized but when first used.\n-   `def` is not evaluated when it is first declared, but is evaluated every time a call is made. Hence `print(\"z\")` occurs every time `z` is used.\n\nSo, did you manage to get the right answer? Let's check:  \nHope you got it right! If not, try going through the steps again.\n\n  \n\n\n### Function Parameters\n\nNow that we have covered `var`s, `val`s, `def`s and `lazy val`s. Let's look inside the functions. When we define functions, the parameters are `val` values. Here is a demonstration showing that once a parameter is received by a function, its value can't be changed:\n\n#### Call by value v/s Call by name\n\nBy default in Scala, function parameters are evaluated before the function is applied/called. This evaluation strategy for function parameters is called **call by value**.  \n  \nThe above statement shows Scala's depicts a call by value behaviour when a function is executed. First, the arguments passed to it are executed, and then the other statements in the body of the function.  \nHowever, we may want to avoid evaluating arguments as soon as the function is executed, and rather delay its execution until it is actually used. This may help us to avoid unnecessary evaluation which may never be needed during the execution of the function. This strategy is called **call by name**.  \n  \nTo accept a parameter as a call by name parameter, we insert a `=>` just before parameter type, like: `a : => Int` (This is the syntactic sugar for writing as `a : () => Int`). Observe the execution statements in the above snippet. The body of the function executes first, and the argument is evaluated only when it is actually needed.  \n  \n\n\n### Anonymous Functions\n\nAnonymous functions also behave in the same way as normal functions and accept arguments as `val`s.  \n\n\nNote that writing functions using `val` is simply assigning a variable name to an anonymous function.  \n  \n\n\n### Class Parameters\n\nA class in Scala can take parameters, which is regarded as its primary constructor. These parameters can be `var`s or `val`s.  \nEach instance of a class can be `var` or `val` too. But if we wish to create an immutable data structure, assigning an instance to a `val` is not sufficient. Instead, we must use `val` for class parameters too.  \n\n\nA simple class can be created as without specifying a var or val. In that case, the member is private.  \n  \n\n\n### Case Class\n\nA case class can also have `var` and val, but often it is used without keyword, and it defaults to `public val`. In fact, the use of `var` is 'strongly discouraged'.  \n  \n\n\nWhile we started with something really trivial, but we have covered a lot just by trying to understand how variables are declared and used in Scala programs. A lot of things I have just touched, and a lot are still left unexplored. But as I continue to program, I hope to continue to stumble into more and more challenges of writing beautiful code, and continue to write more and more about them here.\n",

Let's quickly glance over what we will be looking into:  \n\n\n-   [`var`s](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1167440767733751967&pli=1#vars)\n-   [`val`s](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1167440767733751967&pli=1#vals)\n-   [`def`](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1167440767733751967&pli=1#defs)\n-   -   [functions v/s methods, difference b/w `val` and `def`](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1167440767733751967&pli=1#fvsm)\n-   [`lazy val`](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1167440767733751967&pli=1#lazy_vals)\n-   -   [a small exercise](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1167440767733751967&pli=1#exercise)\n-   [function parameters](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1167440767733751967&pli=1#function_params)\n-   -   [call by value v/s call by name](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1167440767733751967&pli=1#evaluation_strategies)\n-   [anonymous function](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1167440767733751967&pli=1#anon_functions)\n-   [class parameters](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1167440767733751967&pli=1#class_params)\n-   [case class parameters](https://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=1167440767733751967&pli=1#case_class_params)\n\nAs we go through all of the above, we shall take a peek into the related concepts.\n\n  \n\n\n### `var`s, that are allowed to vary\n\nIf you're coming from the Java world like me, then the simplest way to declare + define a variable is\n\n  \n\n\nYou can, sometime later, change this value as shown above.  \nA `var` must be initialized at the same place it is declared. The only place where it can be left undefined is when it is declared inside an abstract class or trait:\n\n  \n\n\n### `val`s, that can't vary\n\n-   `val`s are absolute values, which once assigned cannot be changed/reassigned at any point of time in the program.\n-   Like `var`s, `val`s cannot be left undefined outside of an abstract class or trait. But this is kind of obvious here, for something that cannot be changed later must not be left uninitialized.\n\n`val` should be the goto way of using variables, as it helps to **design immutable structures**. While there can be a lot written about immutable data structures, in short we can say that by using immutable values we can avoid the risk of changing them later unintentionally.\n\n  \n\n\n### Define a variable with `def`\n\nWe can also write a variable using `def`:\n\nObserve here, the REPL doesn't indicate the value of `x`, it just calls out that it has registered `x` with itself. Only when I call this _function `x`_ in the next step, that the execution happens. This is unlike what we have seen for `var` and `val`, where the REPL clearly indicates that it is storing an identifier `x` with a value `42`.  \n\n\nI had seen this style being used in a lot of places, and I found it weird. Why define a variable the way we define a function? When I can write something as `val x = 42`, what difference it makes if I write the statement as `def x = 42` ? Both can be invoked in the same way also:\n\n  \n\n\nThis is because **Scala differentiates between functions and methods**. The 'functions' we are calling out by using `def` is technically not a function but a method. Defining using `val` gives us the function in real sense in Scala.  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l4lUeMRIY2M/XadmgbFuDVI/AAAAAAAALA0/qUGzB2tcbGscuPR4RCXiGGwbjKYkFO9ZwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/scala_meme.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l4lUeMRIY2M/XadmgbFuDVI/AAAAAAAALA0/qUGzB2tcbGscuPR4RCXiGGwbjKYkFO9ZwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/scala_meme.jpg)\n\n  \n  \n\n\n#### Functions v/s Methods\n\nLet's divert briefly to understand the spaghetti that functions and methods are:  \n\n\n-   Functions in scala are instances of `Function0` - `Function22` class, and `Function` class contains methods such as `apply`, `toString`, `compose`, `andThen`. Hence, these functions can be applied on values defined using `val`.\n-   Methods in scala are a part of a class, just like a method in Java. These methods have access to other members of the same class. Methods also contain an implicit reference to `this`. And that is why we can call `map` on `List` (`map` has access to the instance of `List` it has been called upon).\n-   Hence, when we want certain behaviours as a part of a class, we define methods on that class, and for all other purposes, we use functions.\n\nLet's come back to where we left. In terms of evaluation, one difference there is: a value defined using `val` is evaluated at the very point, whereas, a value defined using a `def` is evaluated only when it is called.\n\n  \n\n\nHere, that I have added a print statement at the time of definition. Observe that, `val x` is evaluated immediately at the time of definition, and is never evaluated ever again. On the other hand, `def y` is not evaluated at the time of definition but is rather delayed till its invocation. However, it is evaluated again each time `y` is used (This is synonymous with what is expected from a function).\n\nWhile delaying execution till the time may be loosely termed as _lazy_, but this is not entirely lazy, as the execution happens every time the value is used.\n\n### Make a value lazy with lazy val\n\nIn scala, a value can be made explicitly lazy using the keyword `lazy` before declaring a `val`. This means:  \n\n\n-   The value is not evaluated till its first use,\n-   The evaluated result is then stored and reused whenever the value is used later.\n-   If in a program, a `lazy val` is defined but never used, it is never evaluated.\n-   Lazy `val`s can be used to implement **memoization** technique.\n\nThe above snippet first shows the simple case, just add the keyword `lazy` with `val` to make a word lazy. In the next case, we add a print statement to show when is the actual execution is taking place. Observe here that \"y is executed\" is printed only when the `y` is used for the first time.  \n  \n\n\n#### A small exercise\n\nLet's go through a small exercise that I found as a part of [Functional Programming Design in Scala course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun2?specialization=scala), that may help to realize some of the above differences discussed above.  \nWhat should be the result of `println(expr)`?  \n  \nLet's summarize how `val`, `lazy val` and `def` works here:  \n\n\n-   `val` evaluates the expression on initialization and stores the value with itself. Hence `print(\"x\")` occurs just the first time `val x` it is initialized.\n-   `lazy val` does not evaluate the expression when initialized. Rather, it evaluates when it is first used, and then stores the value with itself. Hence, `print(\"y\")` occurs not when it is initialized but when first used.\n-   `def` is not evaluated when it is first declared, but is evaluated every time a call is made. Hence `print(\"z\")` occurs every time `z` is used.\n\nSo, did you manage to get the right answer? Let's check:  \nHope you got it right! If not, try going through the steps again.\n\n  \n\n\n### Function Parameters\n\nNow that we have covered `var`s, `val`s, `def`s and `lazy val`s. Let's look inside the functions. When we define functions, the parameters are `val` values. Here is a demonstration showing that once a parameter is received by a function, its value can't be changed:\n\n#### Call by value v/s Call by name\n\nBy default in Scala, function parameters are evaluated before the function is applied/called. This evaluation strategy for function parameters is called **call by value**.  \n  \nThe above statement shows Scala's depicts a call by value behaviour when a function is executed. First, the arguments passed to it are executed, and then the other statements in the body of the function.  \nHowever, we may want to avoid evaluating arguments as soon as the function is executed, and rather delay its execution until it is actually used. This may help us to avoid unnecessary evaluation which may never be needed during the execution of the function. This strategy is called **call by name**.  \n  \nTo accept a parameter as a call by name parameter, we insert a `=>` just before parameter type, like: `a : => Int` (This is the syntactic sugar for writing as `a : () => Int`). Observe the execution statements in the above snippet. The body of the function executes first, and the argument is evaluated only when it is actually needed.  \n  \n\n\n### Anonymous Functions\n\nAnonymous functions also behave in the same way as normal functions and accept arguments as `val`s.  \n\n\nNote that writing functions using `val` is simply assigning a variable name to an anonymous function.  \n  \n\n\n### Class Parameters\n\nA class in Scala can take parameters, which is regarded as its primary constructor. These parameters can be `var`s or `val`s.  \nEach instance of a class can be `var` or `val` too. But if we wish to create an immutable data structure, assigning an instance to a `val` is not sufficient. Instead, we must use `val` for class parameters too.  \n\n\nA simple class can be created as without specifying a var or val. In that case, the member is private.  \n  \n\n\n### Case Class\n\nA case class can also have `var` and val, but often it is used without keyword, and it defaults to `public val`. In fact, the use of `var` is 'strongly discouraged'.  \n  \n\n\nWhile we started with something really trivial, but we have covered a lot just by trying to understand how variables are declared and used in Scala programs. A lot of things I have just touched, and a lot are still left unexplored. But as I continue to program, I hope to continue to stumble into more and more challenges of writing beautiful code, and continue to write more and more about them here.\n"

            "rawMarkdownBody": "\nLet's talk about testing today. And testing is _hard_. The most common way we have been testing is what is known as **Example Based Testing**.  \nFollowing steps are followed for writing test cases:  \n\n\n-   We start by taking a function\n-   To write a test for the chosen function, we start by defining a set of inputs and the expected outputs.\n-   For each test, we call this function for an input and match it with some expected value.\n\nHow do we practice testing? When given a feature:  \n\n\n-   we write the test cases first,\n-   run the test cases, verify that they fail,\n-   implement the function at hand,\n-   run the test cases against our implementation,\n-   make sure all test cases pass.\n\nLet's start with an example. I will be using ScalaTest framework for this small example function, say `add`.  \nLet's write a few test cases for the `add` function:  \n  \nNow I implement my add function:  \nObviously, I am being a bad programmer here. My test fails. But I can be worse. Now I have to deliver this thing, and for that, the test cases must pass. So I do whatever it takes.  \n  \nCool. Now my test case pass. But hey! this is not over yet. I try to get this pushed, but I can't really get away with just one test case. Huh! Let's add some more.  \nNow given my implementation of `add` above, one of my test cases are failing. But I am bent on passing my test cases by hook or by crook. So now I implement:  \nNow you would say one day or the other I will be caught, but I can always handle test cases like this. You would also say that this example is too obvious. Yes, I agree. But not all code is this obvious, and not all coders are malicious. This example shows that test cases can pass even when the code is bad and the logic is broken.  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1208/1*ok5iNXeD1HjzDHhKUcl5cQ.gif)](https://miro.medium.com/max/1208/1*ok5iNXeD1HjzDHhKUcl5cQ.gif)\n\n  \nSo how do we correct this? One solution is trusting developers with their coding skills and let the error flow until it blows up in production. Or... try Property Based Testing.  \n  \n\n\n### Property Based Testing\n\nWhat is property based testing? In property based testing, instead of providing a specific set of input for each test case, we write properties.  \n  \n\n\n#### Property\n\nProperty is nothing but a testable unit. In property based testing, these properties need to be satisfied by the function we need to test. If we take a combined look at all the properties defined for a function, it should indicate the behaviour of the function under any circumstance. Now that we have defined a property, what sort of properties can we think up for our code? Let's move ahead with our `add` example.\n\n  \nWhat can be the properties of an `add` function?  \n\n\n-   Adding by 0 can be a good start. We know add on a number and 0 must give out the number. We call this property **identity**. So: `add(x,0)=x`\n\nLet's run this property:  \n\n\n    [info] ! Add.identity: Falsified after 0 passed tests.\n    [info] > ARG_0: 0\n    [info] > ARG_0_ORIGINAL: 1\n\n  \nThis test failed as expected, but the property alone is not sufficient. Suppose our bad code already contains this handling:  \nLet's run this property now:  \n\n\n    > test\n    > [info] AddTest:\n    > [info] + Add.identity: OK, passed 100 tests.\n\n  \nThis test easily passed. There can be many wrong such implementations of a function on an integer that return the same integer back. What properties can make `add` fool-proof to test?  \nLet's try putting one more property:  \n\n\n-   Flipping the order of inputs to add should return the same result. So: add(x,y) = add(y,x). We call this property **commutative**, which will help us distinguish the `add` from functions such as `subtract`. Looks like this should work. Let's try:\n\n  \nRunning this now:  \n\n\n    > test\n    > [info] AddTest:\n    > [info] + Add.identity: OK, passed 100 tests.\n    > [info] + Add.commutative: OK, passed 100 tests.\n\n  \nShockingly, our commutative property does not suffice. But why? Let's try printing the randomly generated tests here:  \nRunning tests now:  \n\n\n    > test\n    > [info] AddTest:\n    x = -283328897 and y = 1735471989\n    x = 2147483647 and y = 1\n    x = 902184796 and y = 0\n    x = 1761670528 and y = 2147483647\n    x = -1 and y = 1\n    x = -1766910549 and y = -2147483648\n    x = -1079495038 and y = -306732024\n    x = -1 and y = 1\n    x = -1 and y = -595376862\n    x = -1267109685 and y = 1221874588\n    x = 1710402698 and y = 1\n    x = 0 and y = 2147483647\n    x = -1496107197 and y = 1555536417\n    x = -1010882575 and y = 0\n    x = -148217383 and y = 1785131788\n    x = 2147483647 and y = 1\n    x = -1032994959 and y = -1\n    x = -207729455 and y = -1\n    x = -1 and y = -2147483648\n    x = -274047330 and y = 1\n    x = 931105896 and y = 0\n    x = -1 and y = 7392559\n    x = -1629543210 and y = -505234372\n    x = -2147483648 and y = -997498258\n    x = 664666819 and y = -2147483648\n    x = 0 and y = -1\n    x = 1 and y = -601536489\n    x = -2147483648 and y = -1\n    x = 810956687 and y = 1\n    x = 2147483647 and y = 1425588316\n    x = -1599729503 and y = 2147483647\n    x = -1 and y = 1\n    x = 1 and y = -1994173278\n    x = -1765121205 and y = -1\n    x = -2147483648 and y = -444252352\n    x = -94848801 and y = -418331736\n    x = 2147483647 and y = -2147483648\n    x = -1041475063 and y = -2066395354\n    x = 1426790203 and y = -1\n    x = -2147483648 and y = 1\n    x = 1 and y = 579849916\n    x = -1791008680 and y = -831946485\n    x = 0 and y = -128557305\n    x = -2147483648 and y = 0\n    x = 1 and y = 2147483647\n    x = -2108632480 and y = 1\n    x = 2147483647 and y = 1\n    x = -2100778803 and y = 1569433578\n    x = 0 and y = 0\n    x = 0 and y = -1321862054\n    x = -2147483648 and y = 574473982\n    x = 1992767230 and y = -235589010\n    x = 2147483647 and y = 936713378\n    x = 2147483647 and y = -2147483648\n    x = 479454965 and y = 791321877\n    x = 1673114886 and y = 32065938\n    x = 1143030900 and y = 1157140989\n    x = 1025857191 and y = 1355198771\n    x = -2048789776 and y = -1\n    x = 1790440328 and y = -173381408\n    x = -1 and y = 1\n    x = 368281449 and y = 1289228540\n    x = -302533624 and y = -1550296909\n    x = -2033588754 and y = 1\n    x = -1 and y = -2147483648\n    x = -2147483648 and y = -400996116\n    x = -1 and y = 1531590967\n    x = 0 and y = -2147483648\n    x = 1 and y = 1\n    x = -1682888892 and y = 951314722\n    x = -921144956 and y = -2147483648\n    x = 0 and y = 1257974224\n    x = 0 and y = 1303946082\n    x = 1642155181 and y = 2147483647\n    x = -2147483648 and y = 2147483647\n    x = 1 and y = -2147483648\n    x = 0 and y = -397273960\n    x = 924610080 and y = -2147483648\n    x = 1 and y = 1\n    x = -167739585 and y = -1\n    x = -2018431545 and y = -597953303\n    x = 1099702277 and y = -2034975121\n    x = -791315953 and y = -1489117288\n    x = -1708172828 and y = -911743133\n    x = 1 and y = 2147483647\n    x = -355069252 and y = 1\n    x = -1367711777 and y = -523554244\n    x = 2035562490 and y = -1\n    x = -2147483648 and y = 0\n    x = 749057419 and y = -2068921504\n    x = -1 and y = 231975227\n    x = -831717683 and y = -252453652\n    x = -2147483648 and y = 2147483647\n    x = 1799244601 and y = -1\n    [info] + Add.identity: OK, passed 100 tests.\n    x = 2147483647 and y = 2147483647\n    x = 1 and y = -2147483648\n    x = -2147483648 and y = -95933741\n    x = 1 and y = 2147483647\n    x = -2147483648 and y = 2147483647\n    x = -2147483648 and y = -987661912\n    [info] + Add.commutative: OK, passed 100 tests.\n\n  \nAs we see here, a lot of random test cases are generated, but our implementation puts a default answer for all the test cases that it doesn't cover, i.e. 42. So if `x = 1099702277` and `y = -2034975121`, `add(1099702277,-2034975121)` = 42 = `add(-2034975121,2034975121)`.  \n  \nSo is our property wrong? No, it isn't, but it's not sufficient.  \n\n\n-   So what can be other properties that `add` and only `add` can exhibit? One property can be: `the result of adding 2 positive integers is always greater than or equal to both the integers`. Now let's implement this property. Observe that here, we can not directly apply this property for all integers, rather for only positive integers. How do we achieve that?\n\nHere comes the role of Generators.  \n  \n\n\n### Generators\n\nGenerators are used to generate a specific set of data. Let's try Generators for our use case:  \n  \nHere, `Gen.posNum[Int]` generates a set of positive integers. The `Gen` class has a lot more methods like this. For example, if you need your data to be positive integers greater than 1000 only:  \n  \nTesting this:  \n\n\n    > test\n    > [info] AddTest:\n    [info] + Add.identity: OK, passed 100 tests.\n    [info] + Add.commutative: OK, passed 100 tests.\n    [info] ! Add.the result of adding 2 positive integers is always greater than or equal to both the integers: Falsified after 0 passed tests.\n    [info] > ARG_0: 1\n    [info] > ARG_0_ORIGINAL: 722748975\n    [info] > ARG_1: 59\n    [info] > ARG_1_ORIGINAL: 378231530\n    [info] ScalaCheck\n    [info] Failed: Total 3, Failed 1, Errors 0, Passed 2\n\n  \nOne more thing to mention here.

Some properties can directly be derived from their mathematical counterparts.\n-   Try `reverse`. Some properties can be derived by trying to reverse the order of inputs. Supose in case of sorting a list, the reverse of a list should produce the same output.\n-   Change the order of inputs. Some properties can be derived by changing the order of inputs/operations but arriving on the same output. This we have seen in the `add` function as well.\n-   Use Induction. Just like mathematical induction, we can verify if a property stands true for a smaller part, then it should work for the larger part as well.\n-   and... a lot more that I am not covering here.\n\nThere are many more ways in which we can think of defining properties. Still not able to? May be that is indicative of some deeper problem with the code itself. Maybe this is a call for abstracting general behaviours out of your program now.  \n\n\n  \nIt's been a while that PBT has existed, and its poularity has been growing ever since. It is being used in a number of real world applications. I myself am using it at my work.

One solution is trusting developers with their coding skills and let the error flow until it blows up in production. Or… try Property Based Testing.  </p>\n<h3>Property Based Testing</h3>\n<p>What is property based testing? In property based testing, instead of providing a specific set of input for each test case, we write properties.  </p>\n<h4>Property</h4>\n<p>Property is nothing but a testable unit. In property based testing, these properties need to be satisfied by the function we need to test. If we take a combined look at all the properties defined for a function, it should indicate the behaviour of the function under any circumstance. Now that we have defined a property, what sort of properties can we think up for our code? Let’s move ahead with our <code class=\"language-text\">add</code> example.</p>\n<p>What can be the properties of an <code class=\"language-text\">add</code> function?  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding by 0 can be a good start. We know add on a number and 0 must give out the number. We call this property <strong>identity</strong>. So: <code class=\"language-text\">add(x,0)=x</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s run this property:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">[info] ! Add.identity: Falsified after 0 passed tests.\n[info] &gt; ARG_0: 0\n[info] &gt; ARG_0_ORIGINAL: 1</code></pre></div>\n<p>This test failed as expected, but the property alone is not sufficient. Suppose our bad code already contains this handling:<br>\nLet’s run this property now:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&gt; test\n&gt; [info] AddTest:\n&gt; [info] + Add.identity: OK, passed 100 tests.</code></pre></div>\n<p>This test easily passed. There can be many wrong such implementations of a function on an integer that return the same integer back. What properties can make <code class=\"language-text\">add</code> fool-proof to test?<br>\nLet’s try putting one more property:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flipping the order of inputs to add should return the same result. So: add(x,y) = add(y,x). We call this property <strong>commutative</strong>, which will help us distinguish the <code class=\"language-text\">add</code> from functions such as <code class=\"language-text\">subtract</code>. Looks like this should work. Let’s try:</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Running this now:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&gt; test\n&gt; [info] AddTest:\n&gt; [info] + Add.identity: OK, passed 100 tests.\n&gt; [info] + Add.commutative: OK, passed 100 tests.</code></pre></div>\n<p>Shockingly, our commutative property does not suffice.

No, it isn’t, but it’s not sufficient.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>So what can be other properties that <code class=\"language-text\">add</code> and only <code class=\"language-text\">add</code> can exhibit? One property can be: <code class=\"language-text\">the result of adding 2 positive integers is always greater than or equal to both the integers</code>. Now let’s implement this property. Observe that here, we can not directly apply this property for all integers, rather for only positive integers. How do we achieve that?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here comes the role of Generators.  </p>\n<h3>Generators</h3>\n<p>Generators are used to generate a specific set of data. Let’s try Generators for our use case:  </p>\n<p>Here, <code class=\"language-text\">Gen.posNum[Int]</code> generates a set of positive integers. The <code class=\"language-text\">Gen</code> class has a lot more methods like this. For example, if you need your data to be positive integers greater than 1000 only:  </p>\n<p>Testing this:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&gt; test\n&gt; [info] AddTest:\n[info] + Add.identity: OK, passed 100 tests.\n[info] + Add.commutative: OK, passed 100 tests.\n[info] !

We see scala check mentions two cases, one like<br>\n<code class=\"language-text\">ARG_0</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">ARG_1</code>, and other like <code class=\"language-text\">ARG_0_ORIGINAL</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">ARG_1_ORIGINAL</code>. This is a feature called Shrinking.  </p>\n<h3>Shrinking</h3>\n<p>Shrinking is a mechanism by which we can simplify failure cases to present the minimal one, readable to the human eye. So as we see above, there are 2 sets of failed test cases presented, one with ARG<em>0 and ARG</em>1 and the other as ARG<em>0</em>ORIGINAL and ARG<em>1</em>ORIGINAL, where:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">ARG_0: 1\n\nARG_1: 59\n\nARG_0_ORIGINAL: 722748975\nARG_1_ORIGINAL: 378231530</code></pre></div>\n<p>The value of ARG<em>0 and ARG</em>1 is simplified as compared to the original one.  </p>\n<p>We can disable shrinking using <code class=\"language-text\">forAllNoShrink</code> method:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">[IJ]sbt:ScalacheckDemo&gt; test\n[info] Compiling 1 Scala source to /home/ashukla/code/scala/ScalacheckDemo/target/scala-2.13/test-classes ...\n[info] Done compiling.\n[info] + Add.identity: OK, passed 100 tests.\n[info] !

So if `x = 1099702277` and `y = -2034975121`, `add(1099702277,-2034975121)` = 42 = `add(-2034975121,2034975121)`.  \n  \nSo is our property wrong? No, it isn't, but it's not sufficient.  \n\n\n-   So what can be other properties that `add` and only `add` can exhibit? One property can be: `the result of adding 2 positive integers is always greater than or equal to both the integers`. Now let's implement this property. Observe that here, we can not directly apply this property for all integers, rather for only positive integers. How do we achieve that?\n\nHere comes the role of Generators.  \n  \n\n\n### Generators\n\nGenerators are used to generate a specific set of data. Let's try Generators for our use case:  \n  \nHere, `Gen.posNum[Int]` generates a set of positive integers. The `Gen` class has a lot more methods like this. For example, if you need your data to be positive integers greater than 1000 only:  \n  \nTesting this:  \n\n\n    > test\n    > [info] AddTest:\n    [info] + Add.identity: OK, passed 100 tests.\n    [info] + Add.commutative: OK, passed 100 tests.\n    [info] !

We see scala check mentions two cases, one like  \n`ARG_0` and `ARG_1`, and other like `ARG_0_ORIGINAL` and `ARG_1_ORIGINAL`. This is a feature called Shrinking.  \n  \n\n\n### Shrinking\n\nShrinking is a mechanism by which we can simplify failure cases to present the minimal one, readable to the human eye. So as we see above, there are 2 sets of failed test cases presented, one with ARG_0 and ARG_1 and the other as ARG_0_ORIGINAL and ARG_1_ORIGINAL, where:  \n  \n\n\n    ARG_0: 1\n\n    ARG_1: 59\n\n    ARG_0_ORIGINAL: 722748975\n    ARG_1_ORIGINAL: 378231530\n\n  \nThe value of ARG_0 and ARG_1 is simplified as compared to the original one.  \n  \nWe can disable shrinking using `forAllNoShrink` method:  \n  \n  \n\n\n    [IJ]sbt:ScalacheckDemo> test\n    [info] Compiling 1 Scala source to /home/ashukla/code/scala/ScalacheckDemo/target/scala-2.13/test-classes ...\n    [info] Done compiling.\n    [info] + Add.identity: OK, passed 100 tests.\n    [info] !

Let's go deeper and see how we would go about writing tests for a `Tree` data structure...  \n  \nTo create properties using this data structure, we first need tree generators:  \n  \nObserve here that we need to specify the concrete type of `Tree` that we want to generate here, instead of generic types.  \n  \n\n\n### The Art of defining Properties\n\nThroughout this post, we have gone through the process of defining properties for a simple `add` function. We have seen we might be sailing the Titanic if we are not able to define the right properties. Having incorrect/ insufficient test cases is infact more harmful as it gives an illusion of a perfect codebase. Here are a few suggestions when we start thinking about properties:\n\n-   For start, we can brainstorm (or look up Wikipedia) for some basic laws associated with the concerned function, data structure or algorithm. Some properties can directly be derived from their mathematical counterparts.\n-   Try `reverse`. Some properties can be derived by trying to reverse the order of inputs. Supose in case of sorting a list, the reverse of a list should produce the same output.\n-   Change the order of inputs. Some properties can be derived by changing the order of inputs/operations but arriving on the same output. This we have seen in the `add` function as well.\n-   Use Induction. Just like mathematical induction, we can verify if a property stands true for a smaller part, then it should work for the larger part as well.\n-   and... a lot more that I am not covering here.\n\nThere are many more ways in which we can think of defining properties. Still not able to? May be that is indicative of some deeper problem with the code itself. Maybe this is a call for abstracting general behaviours out of your program now.  \n\n\n  \nIt's been a while that PBT has existed, and its poularity has been growing ever since. It is being used in a number of real world applications. I myself am using it at my work. PBT was originally developed as part of QuickCheck framework in Haskell and since then it has been developed in a number of languages. Give it a shot and you might never look back!  \n  \n\n"

What does it mean by folding? In a broad sense, we can say that folds give us the power to evaluate a list by applying an operator between the list elements. First examples that come to mind can be finding the sum on a list of integers, append the elements of a list, etc. To fold, we also need a default value when we come to evaluate the end of list, or over an empty list, hence a seed value. Take a closer look at the type signatures, we can say that folds are much more powerful than these examples, as they also give us the power to change not only the structure of the list, but also the type of list.  \n  \nBoth foldl and foldr take a seed value of type `b`, a list of type `a`, and a function (let's call it `f`). We can notice that `foldl` and `foldr` are only different with regards to `f`.  \n`foldl` takes the seed value `b` and applies it to the head of the list,  \n`foldr` takes the seed value `b` and applies `f` to the end of the list. Let's see how.  \n  \n\n\n### Fold behaviour using examples\n\nSuppose we have a list, and we need to sum over this list. Finding the sum means running over the whole list and adding the elements using `(+)` operator.  \n\n\n    let x = 1 : 2 : 3 : Nil\n    foldl (+) 0 x = ((((0 + 1) + 2 ) + 3 ) + Nil)\n    foldr (+) 0 x = (1 + (2 + (3 + (Nil + 0))))\n\n  \nWhile it all looks ok, what stands out is applying `(+)` on Nil. How is that supposed to behave? Let's assume for now that `(+)` of an operand with `Nil` equals to that operand:  \n\n\n    x = 1 : 2 : 3 : Nil\n    foldl (+) 0 x = ((((0 + 1) + 2 ) + 3 ) + Nil) = (((1 + 2) + 3 ) + Nil) = ((3 + 3) + Nil) = (6 + Nil) = 6\n    foldr (+) 0 x = (1 + (2 + (3 + (Nil + 0)))) = (1 + (2 + (3 + 0))) = (1 + (2 + 3)) = (1 + 5) = 6\n\n  \nA few more examples:  \n`product = foldr (*) 1` or `product = foldl (*) 1`  \n`length = foldr (const (+1)) 0` or `length = foldl (const (1+)) 0`  \nBoth `foldl` and `foldr` produce the same answers.  \n  \nLet's implement both these functions to gain some more insights into their behaviour:  \n\n\n    foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b\n    foldl f z Nil = z\n    foldl f z (h : t) = foldl f (f z h) t\n\n  \n\n\n    foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b\n    foldr f z Nil = z\n    foldr f z (h : t) = f h (foldr f z t)\n\n  \nJotting down the key features here:  \nfoldl is  \n- lazy (Haskell is lazy by default),  \n- tail recursive (the function `f` is applied first, and the recursive call is made later, in `foldl f (f z h) t`),  \n- left associative (consider the example above: `(((0 + 1) + 2 ) + 3 )` )  \nfoldr is  \n- lazy (nothing is evaluated until result is needed),  \n- not tail recursive (recursive call to `foldr` is made first, and then `f` is applied on top of it, in `f h (foldr f z t)`)  \n- right associative (consider the example above: `(1 + (2 + (3 + 0)))` )  \n  \n\n\n### Too lazy to fold infinitely\n\nNow I am going to apply folds on an infinite list and see what happens. Wait what? Obviously, if we call any fold on infinity it's bound to overflow, right? But hey! we just forgot, that these folds are **lazy**. This means, that folds will only evaluate the list unless the result is actually needed. So if we have a function such as `find`:  \n\n\n    findl :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool\n    findl p = foldr (\\a b -> if p b then True else a) False\n\n  \n\n\n    findr :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool\n    findr p = foldr (\\a b -> if p a then True else b) False\n\n  \nObserve that the arguments are reversed for `findl` and `findr`. Now let's try to run these:  \n\n\n    >> findr even [1..]\n    >> True\n    >> findl even [1..]\n    ^CInterrupted\n\n  \nObserve that while `find` using `foldr` gives an answer, but `foldl` doesn't. But should that's how it should be with infinite list? What kind of magic is this `foldr` doing?? Well, it's no magic but laziness. The `foldr` is simply not doing much. Let's have a look at `foldl` and `foldr` implementations again:  \n\n\n    foldl f z (h : t) = foldl f (f z h) t\n    foldr f z (h : t) = f h (foldr f z t)\n\n  \nWhile `foldl` first makes the recursive call, `foldr` first applies the function `f` and then recursively calls itself. But in our case of `find`, the `f` here is a boolean function. So if `f h = True`, then it need not go into evaluating the entire list! But such is not the case with the poor `foldl`. Before even applying `f`, `foldl` needs to recursively call itself (in a way keep looping...). Therefore, `foldl` cannot use `f` until it has worked out its entire nested expression. And hence, `foldr` is always the recommended way of folding. The thing to remember here is that **laziness works for infinite lists when the second argument to the combining function is lazy**. That's why `findr` is possible but not `(+)`. If we remove laziness from the picture, then both the arguments to the function need to be evaluated immediately, and then it won't matter if we are calling `foldl` or `foldr`. Actually it would matter a bit, as `foldl` is tail recursive, and thus would be more efficient.  \n  \nDid not care to read the big para before? let's point what we learnt:  \n- both `foldl` and `foldr` use a combining function having 2 arguments.  \n- if the combining function is lazy in its second argument, `foldr` evaluates for infinite lists, whereas `foldl` doesn't.  \n- This is because `foldl` is implemented in such a way that it has to first construct the entire expression before evaluation, hence stack overflows.  \n- If `foldl` is made strict (there is a `foldl'`), then as tail recursive is more efficient, it can be used to improve the performance of the code.  \n- Hence, `foldr` is the recommended way of folding, in order to preserve lazyness across function composition.  \n- However for strict languages, `foldl` seems a more natural choice.  \n  \n\n\n### What all can be folded\n\nTill now we are seeing list being folded into a single value, but folds are not restricted to end into a single value. They can be anything as long as the type signatures match!  \nThere is something special about `foldr` if we take a different perspective. Till now we consider `foldr` as 'folding from the right', which, well, is like that. Let's look again at our foldr example:  \n\n\n    for the list 1 : 2 : 3 : Nil\n    foldr f z x = 1 `f` 2 `f` 3 `f` z\n\nThe similarity is quite striking! for every foldr operation, the cons `(:)` operator is replaced by infix `f` and `Nil` is replaced by `z`. This is what we call **constructor replacement**. Therefore, we can use `foldr` for actually replacing the list constructor.  \n\n\n  \n\n\n#### map\n\nLet's try mapping over a list using fold:  \n\n\n    map f =  foldr _f _z\n\nLet's now fill in `_f :: (a -> b -> b)`. For mapping over a list, we do not need to change the structure of the list. Hence, we need `(:)`. But just `(:)` is not sufficient. So at any point of time, if we are dealing with an element `a`, then we need it to be first transformed into `b` and then appended to the rest of the list as before. Voila! `_f = ((:) . f)`. Here, `(.)` operator is called **compose**, where `f . g` is equivalent to `\\x -> f (g x)`.  \nNext we need a default value for mapping a list in place of `_z`. What can be the default value for a list? Well, it's `Nil`. Hence:  \n\n\n    map = foldr ((:) . f) Nil\n\n  \n\n\n#### filter\n\nSimilarly, let's think about applying `filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]`  \n\n\n    filter p = foldr _f _z\n\nHere, yet again, a list remains a list hence `_z = Nil`. Now think about `_f`. For filtering a list, at any point of time, if we have an element `a`, for it to go in the list we need to check if it satisfies the predicate `p` and then if it does we add it else we don't. So `_f = \\a b -> if p a then (a : b) else b`. Hence:  \n\n\n    filter = foldr (\\a b -> if p a then (a : b) else b) Nil\n\n  \n\n\n#### append\n\nLet's make it more challenging. What about appending two lists? i.e. implementing `(++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]`  \n\n\n    (++) xs ys = foldr _f _z\n\nso what should be the ending/default value `_z`? For appending two lists together, we need that in `Nil` of first list, we get the second list. Hence `_z = ys`:  \n\n\n    (++) xs ys = foldr (:) ys xs\n\nTo write this in point-free notation, flip the args: `(++) = flip (foldr (:))`  \n\n\n  \nI have dedicated a whole post to fold coz folds are not only widely used, for me they were the first steps into functional programming. Knowing the power of folds eabled me to write implementations of a lot of more functions in a crisp manner (Before that I was pattern matching for everything). I am a merrier fp programmer now that I have folded!\n",

What does it mean by folding? In a broad sense, we can say that folds give us the power to evaluate a list by applying an operator between the list elements. First examples that come to mind can be finding the sum on a list of integers, append the elements of a list, etc. To fold, we also need a default value when we come to evaluate the end of list, or over an empty list, hence a seed value. Take a closer look at the type signatures, we can say that folds are much more powerful than these examples, as they also give us the power to change not only the structure of the list, but also the type of list.  </p>\n<p>Both foldl and foldr take a seed value of type <code class=\"language-text\">b</code>, a list of type <code class=\"language-text\">a</code>, and a function (let’s call it <code class=\"language-text\">f</code>). We can notice that <code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> are only different with regards to <code class=\"language-text\">f</code>.<br>\n<code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code> takes the seed value <code class=\"language-text\">b</code> and applies it to the head of the list,<br>\n<code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> takes the seed value <code class=\"language-text\">b</code> and applies <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> to the end of the list. Let’s see how.  </p>\n<h3>Fold behaviour using examples</h3>\n<p>Suppose we have a list, and we need to sum over this list. Finding the sum means running over the whole list and adding the elements using <code class=\"language-text\">(+)</code> operator.  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">let x = 1 : 2 : 3 : Nil\nfoldl (+) 0 x = ((((0 + 1) + 2 ) + 3 ) + Nil)\nfoldr (+) 0 x = (1 + (2 + (3 + (Nil + 0))))</code></pre></div>\n<p>While it all looks ok, what stands out is applying <code class=\"language-text\">(+)</code> on Nil. How is that supposed to behave? Let’s assume for now that <code class=\"language-text\">(+)</code> of an operand with <code class=\"language-text\">Nil</code> equals to that operand:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">x = 1 : 2 : 3 : Nil\nfoldl (+) 0 x = ((((0 + 1) + 2 ) + 3 ) + Nil) = (((1 + 2) + 3 ) + Nil) = ((3 + 3) + Nil) = (6 + Nil) = 6\nfoldr (+) 0 x = (1 + (2 + (3 + (Nil + 0)))) = (1 + (2 + (3 + 0))) = (1 + (2 + 3)) = (1 + 5) = 6</code></pre></div>\n<p>A few more examples:<br>\n<code class=\"language-text\">product = foldr (*) 1</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">product = foldl (*) 1</code><br>\n<code class=\"language-text\">length = foldr (const (+1)) 0</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">length = foldl (const (1+)) 0</code><br>\nBoth <code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> produce the same answers.  </p>\n<p>Let’s implement both these functions to gain some more insights into their behaviour:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">foldl :: (b -&gt; a -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b\nfoldl f z Nil = z\nfoldl f z (h : t) = foldl f (f z h) t\n\n\n\n\nfoldr :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; [a] -&gt; b\nfoldr f z Nil = z\nfoldr f z (h : t) = f h (foldr f z t)</code></pre></div>\n<p>Jotting down the key features here:<br>\nfoldl is  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>lazy (Haskell is lazy by default),  </li>\n<li>tail recursive (the function <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> is applied first, and the recursive call is made later, in <code class=\"language-text\">foldl f (f z h) t</code>),  </li>\n<li>left associative (consider the example above: <code class=\"language-text\">(((0 + 1) + 2 ) + 3 )</code> )<br>\nfoldr is  </li>\n<li>lazy (nothing is evaluated until result is needed),  </li>\n<li>not tail recursive (recursive call to <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> is made first, and then <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> is applied on top of it, in <code class=\"language-text\">f h (foldr f z t)</code>)  </li>\n<li>right associative (consider the example above: <code class=\"language-text\">(1 + (2 + (3 + 0)))</code> )  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Too lazy to fold infinitely</h3>\n<p>Now I am going to apply folds on an infinite list and see what happens. Wait what? Obviously, if we call any fold on infinity it’s bound to overflow, right? But hey! we just forgot, that these folds are <strong>lazy</strong>. This means, that folds will only evaluate the list unless the result is actually needed. So if we have a function such as <code class=\"language-text\">find</code>:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">findl :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool\nfindl p = foldr (\\a b -&gt; if p b then True else a) False\n\n\n\n\nfindr :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; Bool\nfindr p = foldr (\\a b -&gt; if p a then True else b) False</code></pre></div>\n<p>Observe that the arguments are reversed for <code class=\"language-text\">findl</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">findr</code>. Now let’s try to run these:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">&gt;&gt; findr even [1..]\n&gt;&gt; True\n&gt;&gt; findl even [1..]\n^CInterrupted</code></pre></div>\n<p>Observe that while <code class=\"language-text\">find</code> using <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> gives an answer, but <code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code> doesn’t. But should that’s how it should be with infinite list? What kind of magic is this <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> doing?? Well, it’s no magic but laziness. The <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> is simply not doing much. Let’s have a look at <code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> implementations again:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">foldl f z (h : t) = foldl f (f z h) t\nfoldr f z (h : t) = f h (foldr f z t)</code></pre></div>\n<p>While <code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code> first makes the recursive call, <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> first applies the function <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> and then recursively calls itself. But in our case of <code class=\"language-text\">find</code>, the <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> here is a boolean function. So if <code class=\"language-text\">f h = True</code>, then it need not go into evaluating the entire list! But such is not the case with the poor <code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code>. Before even applying <code class=\"language-text\">f</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code> needs to recursively call itself (in a way keep looping…). Therefore, <code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code> cannot use <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> until it has worked out its entire nested expression. And hence, <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> is always the recommended way of folding. The thing to remember here is that <strong>laziness works for infinite lists when the second argument to the combining function is lazy</strong>. That’s why <code class=\"language-text\">findr</code> is possible but not <code class=\"language-text\">(+)</code>. If we remove laziness from the picture, then both the arguments to the function need to be evaluated immediately, and then it won’t matter if we are calling <code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code>. Actually it would matter a bit, as <code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code> is tail recursive, and thus would be more efficient.  </p>\n<p>Did not care to read the big para before? let’s point what we learnt:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>both <code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> use a combining function having 2 arguments.  </li>\n<li>if the combining function is lazy in its second argument, <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> evaluates for infinite lists, whereas <code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code> doesn’t.  </li>\n<li>This is because <code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code> is implemented in such a way that it has to first construct the entire expression before evaluation, hence stack overflows.  </li>\n<li>If <code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code> is made strict (there is a <code class=\"language-text\">foldl&#39;</code>), then as tail recursive is more efficient, it can be used to improve the performance of the code.  </li>\n<li>Hence, <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> is the recommended way of folding, in order to preserve lazyness across function composition.  </li>\n<li>However for strict languages, <code class=\"language-text\">foldl</code> seems a more natural choice.  </li>\n</ul>\n<h3>What all can be folded</h3>\n<p>Till now we are seeing list being folded into a single value, but folds are not restricted to end into a single value. They can be anything as long as the type signatures match!<br>\nThere is something special about <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> if we take a different perspective. Till now we consider <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> as ‘folding from the right’, which, well, is like that. Let’s look again at our foldr example:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">for the list 1 : 2 : 3 : Nil\nfoldr f z x = 1 `f` 2 `f` 3 `f` z</code></pre></div>\n<p>The similarity is quite striking! for every foldr operation, the cons <code class=\"language-text\">(:)</code> operator is replaced by infix <code class=\"language-text\">f</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">Nil</code> is replaced by <code class=\"language-text\">z</code>. This is what we call <strong>constructor replacement</strong>. Therefore, we can use <code class=\"language-text\">foldr</code> for actually replacing the list constructor.  </p>\n<h4>map</h4>\n<p>Let’s try mapping over a list using fold:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">map f =  foldr _f _z</code></pre></div>\n<p>Let’s now fill in <code class=\"language-text\">_f :: (a -&gt; b -&gt; b)</code>. For mapping over a list, we do not need to change the structure of the list. Hence, we need <code class=\"language-text\">(:)</code>. But just <code class=\"language-text\">(:)</code> is not sufficient. So at any point of time, if we are dealing with an element <code class=\"language-text\">a</code>, then we need it to be first transformed into <code class=\"language-text\">b</code> and then appended to the rest of the list as before. Voila! <code class=\"language-text\">_f = ((:) . f)</code>. Here, <code class=\"language-text\">(.)</code> operator is called <strong>compose</strong>, where <code class=\"language-text\">f . g</code> is equivalent to <code class=\"language-text\">\\x -&gt; f (g x)</code>.<br>\nNext we need a default value for mapping a list in place of <code class=\"language-text\">_z</code>. What can be the default value for a list? Well, it’s <code class=\"language-text\">Nil</code>. Hence:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">map = foldr ((:) . f) Nil</code></pre></div>\n<h4>filter</h4>\n<p>Similarly, let’s think about applying <code class=\"language-text\">filter :: (a -&gt; Bool) -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]</code>  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">filter p = foldr _f _z</code></pre></div>\n<p>Here, yet again, a list remains a list hence <code class=\"language-text\">_z = Nil</code>. Now think about <code class=\"language-text\">_f</code>. For filtering a list, at any point of time, if we have an element <code class=\"language-text\">a</code>, for it to go in the list we need to check if it satisfies the predicate <code class=\"language-text\">p</code> and then if it does we add it else we don’t. So <code class=\"language-text\">_f = \\a b -&gt; if p a then (a : b) else b</code>. Hence:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">filter = foldr (\\a b -&gt; if p a then (a : b) else b) Nil</code></pre></div>\n<h4>append</h4>\n<p>Let’s make it more challenging. What about appending two lists? i.e. implementing <code class=\"language-text\">(++) :: [a] -&gt; [a] -&gt; [a]</code>  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">(++) xs ys = foldr _f _z</code></pre></div>\n<p>so what should be the ending/default value <code class=\"language-text\">_z</code>? For appending two lists together, we need that in <code class=\"language-text\">Nil</code> of first list, we get the second list. Hence <code class=\"language-text\">_z = ys</code>:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">(++) xs ys = foldr (:) ys xs</code></pre></div>\n<p>To write this in point-free notation, flip the args: <code class=\"language-text\">(++) = flip (foldr (:))</code>  </p>\n<p>I have dedicated a whole post to fold coz folds are not only widely used, for me they were the first steps into functional programming.

Let's see how.  \n  \n\n\n### Fold behaviour using examples\n\nSuppose we have a list, and we need to sum over this list. Finding the sum means running over the whole list and adding the elements using `(+)` operator.  \n\n\n    let x = 1 : 2 : 3 : Nil\n    foldl (+) 0 x = ((((0 + 1) + 2 ) + 3 ) + Nil)\n    foldr (+) 0 x = (1 + (2 + (3 + (Nil + 0))))\n\n  \nWhile it all looks ok, what stands out is applying `(+)` on Nil.

Let's assume for now that `(+)` of an operand with `Nil` equals to that operand:  \n\n\n    x = 1 : 2 : 3 : Nil\n    foldl (+) 0 x = ((((0 + 1) + 2 ) + 3 ) + Nil) = (((1 + 2) + 3 ) + Nil) = ((3 + 3) + Nil) = (6 + Nil) = 6\n    foldr (+) 0 x = (1 + (2 + (3 + (Nil + 0)))) = (1 + (2 + (3 + 0))) = (1 + (2 + 3)) = (1 + 5) = 6\n\n  \nA few more examples:  \n`product = foldr (*) 1` or `product = foldl (*) 1`  \n`length = foldr (const (+1)) 0` or `length = foldl (const (1+)) 0`  \nBoth `foldl` and `foldr` produce the same answers.  \n  \nLet's implement both these functions to gain some more insights into their behaviour:  \n\n\n    foldl :: (b -> a -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b\n    foldl f z Nil = z\n    foldl f z (h : t) = foldl f (f z h) t\n\n  \n\n\n    foldr :: (a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b\n    foldr f z Nil = z\n    foldr f z (h : t) = f h (foldr f z t)\n\n  \nJotting down the key features here:  \nfoldl is  \n- lazy (Haskell is lazy by default),  \n- tail recursive (the function `f` is applied first, and the recursive call is made later, in `foldl f (f z h) t`),  \n- left associative (consider the example above: `(((0 + 1) + 2 ) + 3 )` )  \nfoldr is  \n- lazy (nothing is evaluated until result is needed),  \n- not tail recursive (recursive call to `foldr` is made first, and then `f` is applied on top of it, in `f h (foldr f z t)`)  \n- right associative (consider the example above: `(1 + (2 + (3 + 0)))` )  \n  \n\n\n### Too lazy to fold infinitely\n\nNow I am going to apply folds on an infinite list and see what happens.

The certification calls for not mere knowledge but prior hands-on with the GCP suite.  \n  \n\n\n### Google Resources\n\nThere are plenty of resources, provided by Google to prepare for the Data Engineer Certification. Here's the list:  \n\n\n-   [Certification Exam Guide](https://cloud.google.com/certification/guides/data-engineer/)\n-   [Coursera GCP Data Engineer Series](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/gcp-data-machine-learning)\n-   [Google Training](https://cloud.google.com/training/data-ml)\n-   [QuickLabs GCP Essentials](https://google.qwiklabs.com/quests/23?locale=en)\n-   [QuickLabs Data Engineer Quest](https://google.qwiklabs.com/quests/25?locale=en)\n-   [Practice Exam](https://cloud.google.com/certification/practice-exam/data-engineer)\n\n### My take on GCP Data Engineer Certification\n\nAs previously said, the GCP Data Engineer exam requires not only theory, but hands-on experience on these tools. I did have some experience with some of them, but definitely not all of them!\n\nWhat helped me with this was the Coursera GCP Data Engineer Series. The course is anyway to go for even if you are not aspiring for the certification. The course extensively teaches you not only the fundamentals, but how to store it, query it, retrieve it, and what to do with it.\n\nThe course is lengthy and thorough (it took me 1 month to finish it). Also, it is not enough for the certification.\n\n  \n\n\nThe exam is quite scenario bases. Thinking that the Case Studies mentioned in the guide only ones coming your way? Nope. There are many more scenario based questions, that are asked, testing your knowledge on the myriad of tools available.\n\n  \nMost of them were based on which were tool was appropriate at what situation.

Use Git\n\nGit is an excellent tool for code collaboration. Let's start with the popular advantages. It offers:  \n\n\n-   distributed development,\n-   feature branching/merging capabilities,\n-   flexible workflow\n\nBut you can put Git to you immediate uses well!  \n\n\n#### Git acts as a central repository for all your code.\n\nSo, you can have a look at your code wherever and whenever you want, as it is always online. I upload most of my personal code at [Github](https://github.com/amita-shukla) so that it is easily accessible to me and as well as to the public.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Git is useful to keep track of code changes.\n\nGit gives you the power to \"rewrite history\", so you can see what the changes you made and discard the changes that you no longer want. The git commit history itself acts as a development log.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Showcase your code to the world\n\nWhen you write awesome code, what is the point in keeping it hidden? Show Off. There is no better demonstration of a programmer's work than his code.  \n  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OGLGVyt9Zl8/WaA4rjPnVWI/AAAAAAAAGQY/FxAzPedcMaAENIChNkhxOo_C_iHPVOplgCEwYBhgL/s320/git.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OGLGVyt9Zl8/WaA4rjPnVWI/AAAAAAAAGQY/FxAzPedcMaAENIChNkhxOo_C_iHPVOplgCEwYBhgL/s1600/git.png)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nBeware! Git is a steep learning curve if you have never tried it before. [Here](http://blog.amitashukla.in/2016/04/how-to-set-up-git-repository.html) is one article to get you started.\n\n  \n\n\n### 2. Learn Regex\n\nQuite often you must have stumbled upon pattern matching. And be it any programming language you use, regex is a tremendously handy tool to do so. It has the power to search through huge texts of code in the most concise way.  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p2_he1Enp7s/WaA4Vemh4pI/AAAAAAAAGQQ/do8lD19dHo4QifGQZNoYIAj0wBwRHagqwCLcBGAs/s320/regex.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p2_he1Enp7s/WaA4Vemh4pI/AAAAAAAAGQQ/do8lD19dHo4QifGQZNoYIAj0wBwRHagqwCLcBGAs/s1600/regex.png)\n\n  \nHere is the basic regular expression notation:  \n\\[ ] matches a single character contained within the brackets.  \n\\[^ ] matches a single character that is not contained within the brackets.  \n^ matches the first character of the string  \n$ matches the last character of the string  \n\\* matches characters preceding it one or more times  \n  \nThere are several cheat sheets available on the internet, it is useful to keep one bookmarked. [Here](https://www.cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/) is what I keep with me.  \n  \n\n\n### 3. Create aliases for the commands you use most frequently.\n\nSomeone told me if you have used a command for more than 21 times, create an alias for it.\n\n-   It reduces the amount of typing necessary from long commands. Suppose you need to edit one file regularly, by opening it in an editor. You can create an alias such as:\n\n`alias a=\"gedit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf\"`  \nThen just type this single letter command and escape from the tedious task.  \n\n\n-   Aliases can be used as a shorthand for some other version of a command that you use more frequently.\n\n`alias ls=\"ls -lrt\"`, or,\n\n`alias hls=\"hadoop fs -ls\"` and so on.\n\n  \n\n\n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p49gjTFJaDs/WaEhP44LWCI/AAAAAAAAGQk/1HILXtDQIqkx52WydZs5s5WEas_ZiRw2QCLcBGAs/s1600/aliases.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p49gjTFJaDs/WaEhP44LWCI/AAAAAAAAGQk/1HILXtDQIqkx52WydZs5s5WEas_ZiRw2QCLcBGAs/s1600/aliases.png)\n\n  \n\n\nThe problem with aliases is that they are valid only for the current login session. To deal with this, an alias for any user can be added to the_.bashrc_file in that user's[home directory](http://www.linfo.org/home_directory.html). Because this file is read at login, the change will not take effect until the user has logged in again.  \n  \n\n\n### 4. Keep a text editor\n\nWhen we are involved in work, we need some place to keep temporary data, steps of execution or any other random data that we don't want to save but neither to just vanish away when shutting the computer down. And thus having a text editor handy is a plus, be it Notepad++ (it has two plus for a reason), or Sublime Text. Let's discuss some notepad++ features:  \n  \n\n\n-   Multi-tabbed feature that you can create several files at once (double click an empty space beside your current file and you get a new file)\n-   Support for several languages\n-   Syntax highlighting according to the language being used.\n-   Auto completion\n-   Document map etc.\n\n[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k6IpkulQxoU/WaEiy3LJ3uI/AAAAAAAAGQw/XkADFBi2ohYaMZI5moZzGozaXgFI5VD_gCLcBGAs/s1600/notepadpp.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k6IpkulQxoU/WaEiy3LJ3uI/AAAAAAAAGQw/XkADFBi2ohYaMZI5moZzGozaXgFI5VD_gCLcBGAs/s1600/notepadpp.jpg)\n\n  \nKeep all the clutter out of your mind and on a notepad. Want to remember a set of commands? Note them down. Want to remember some file paths? Note them down. Want to remember execution steps? Note them down. At any later point of time, save these notes and get a raw documentation!  \n  \nFor Linux distributions, make Sublime Text your friend.\n\n  \n\n\nBonus tip: Enter`data:text/html, <html contenteditable>` on your google chrome new tab and convert it into a minimalistic notepad.  \n  \n\n\n### 5. Be Active On StackOverflow\n\n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WKxU88pIUII/WaEl8gtUIVI/AAAAAAAAGQ8/1EWVFVnz0uEOwNOEe-2H5WB9kdZ9E-VigCLcBGAs/s320/so.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WKxU88pIUII/WaEl8gtUIVI/AAAAAAAAGQ8/1EWVFVnz0uEOwNOEe-2H5WB9kdZ9E-VigCLcBGAs/s1600/so.jpg)\n\n  \nFiring a query on Google, and getting the answer from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) saves our day (and our career). What we forget is that it is a community run by people like us. And by saying 'being active' I do not mean just anonymously searching the answers to your questions, but creating an account there and actually 'being there' in as many ways possible. But why should you take the burden?  \n  \n\n\n#### It's a give-n-take relationship.\n\nYou get help from other people, and in return, you help other programmers out there. It doesn't take much time, but you will save the time and effort of some other programmer sitting in some other part of the world struggling with the same problem.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Earn Reputation.\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5Jl2Gb8irRw/WaEq4uwjKFI/AAAAAAAAGRM/nYbjzpIyjJsn29g3EileNt6AwwJ4mlWdQCLcBGAs/s1600/so_flair.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5Jl2Gb8irRw/WaEq4uwjKFI/AAAAAAAAGRM/nYbjzpIyjJsn29g3EileNt6AwwJ4mlWdQCLcBGAs/s1600/so_flair.png)\n\n  \n\n\nYour contribution to the community doesn't go in vain. You earn reputation from other programmers who validate your answers and thank you in the form of upvotes termed as 'reputation'. Not only by answering, but even asking the right questions can fetch you reputation. Show it off and earn a high reputation in the real world!\n\n  \n\n\n#### Track yourselves.\n\nOK. This is important. If you do not believe in being 'social', then here is how Stack Overflow can help you. Just be logged in Stack Overflow and you can do a lot more with it. You can mark the questions that you liked as your favourites, or just upvote the answers which helped you. Stack Overflow keeps the record of your activity. Trapped in a situation when you know that the hack to your problem is present in Stack Overflow but can't actually recall it? Just track your activity and dig that question/answer out.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Earn Karma.\n\n\n\n### 6. Keep Linux Commands Handy\n\nThe terminal can be our friend if we know to use its potential to the fullest. Use these to hacks your Linux:  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3lVkUO_0vsg/WaLQskeQJMI/AAAAAAAAGRc/DTk_oTKnwVgVct6BthvBy-kk-6H7dwdxQCLcBGAs/s320/shell.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3lVkUO_0vsg/WaLQskeQJMI/AAAAAAAAGRc/DTk_oTKnwVgVct6BthvBy-kk-6H7dwdxQCLcBGAs/s1600/shell.png)\n\n  \n\n\n#### Tab Completion\n\nNo, no. You don't need to type everything. Just type a letter, and press tab. The tab completion feature completes file names, commands, everything for you.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Pipes\n\nSend the output of one command to another as input using pipes ( | ).  \nOne of the most useful example:  \n`$ ps aux | grep conky | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill`\n\n  \n\n\n#### Wild Cards\n\nThe \\* character – that is, the asterisk – is a wild card that can match anything.  \nFor Example,  \n`rm a*.txt`  \nThis removes all files starting with 'a' that are of .txt format.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Output Redirection\n\n' `>` ' redirects the command output to a file instead of the terminal. This can come handy if you want to save logs of a command in a file.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Launch a command in background using '&'\n\n`firefox &`  \nThis is useful when you want to launch a command but continue using the terminal.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Conditional Execution\n\nYou can have 2 commands run one after the other. Writing a && between the two commands will only execute the 2nd command after the first one successfully executes. For example,  \n`cd /home/user/Documents && ls`  \n\n\n\n\n#### Search and Use the commands from the past\n\nDon't type a command again and again. Press `ctrl+r` and type any key words that you can recall. Shell looks up in the history and finds it for you. Voila!\n\n  \n\n\nThere are so many other tricks out there that an entire post (perhaps a book) can be dedicated to it. Also, a lot more can be done by scripting your long list of commands. I mentioned a few of them in my post [Shell In a Nutshell](http://blog.amitashukla.in/2016/12/shell-in-nutshell.html).  \n  \n\n\n### 7. Learn to make Diagrams and Presentations\n\nIf you end up addressing a large crowd, you will have to make presentations and lots of diagrams. This skill may be secondary, but what good that knowledge is that can't be expressed? Your Office software can be good enough for this, only if you learn to leverage it properly.  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8K18VnEM2aU/WaLZwUrtWuI/AAAAAAAAGRs/RoTEA2IsNk4bbDJQH0jpMBG_mpERnmmWQCLcBGAs/s320/diagrams.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8K18VnEM2aU/WaLZwUrtWuI/AAAAAAAAGRs/RoTEA2IsNk4bbDJQH0jpMBG_mpERnmmWQCLcBGAs/s1600/diagrams.png)\n\n  \n\n\n###   \n\n\n### 8. Read Code. A lot of Code.\n\nThanks to the open source community, you can read the code that you use.\n\n-   Knowing the internal design of your code helps you realize if you are using it right.\n-   Life is short that you can write all the good code out there yourselves. Reading others' code transfers their knowledge to you. But for that, you not only need to 'read', but also understand why something was written that way.\n-   When you know what your code is doing to its depth, you know its strengths and limitations, and brag about it all, and get the appreciation for the knowledge resource you are! You can thank me later :P\n\n  \n\n\n### 9. Make Your Keyboard Your Friend\n\nMake sure your fingers know which key to hit in order to type what are you thinking. If you are still looking down while typing, you are not trusting your keyboard enough. If you have been using the same keyboard for quite some time, look up the screen and type. Just the same way you don't need to figure out how to write when you take notes, you should not think on how to type while coding. It may be obstructive at first, but you won't realize when you start typing at the speed you are thinking.\n\n  \n\n\nAlso, by looking down while typing, you are harming your neck, spine, eyes. Sit straight and type for hours.  \n  \n\n\n### 10. Document What You Learnt\n\nThere is one documentation that we all hate writing. But then there can be one another kind of documentation. Your personal one. Make a habit of documenting what all you learned today. How many times it has happened to you that you see a problem and realize that you have done it before but can't recall it now? You have no option than to do it all over again. Sad.\n\n  \n\n\nMaintaining a personal documentation, or call it a journal, helps you recall quickly the solution to a problem you have already encountered before. Not only this, a day when you feel downright stupid, you can look back at your doc to see the long list of things you have learnt and feel all up!  \n  \n\n\n### 11. Blog\n\nNow that you are maintaining the Journal, if something important pops up. You can go ahead and tell others about it! It also makes you a better presenter. If you can blog about it, you have gained the power to explain it.  \n  \n\n\n### 12. Read Books.\n\nI can't emphasize this point enough. There are excellent pieces of literature whose knowledge out there that are waiting to be digested by you.  \n  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qg88CHCpJB0/WaLfYuH3jSI/AAAAAAAAGR8/AlIVcdNl8sE-bij49SsNeqw0N5dkXOVMQCLcBGAs/s320/how-to-read.jpg)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qg88CHCpJB0/WaLfYuH3jSI/AAAAAAAAGR8/AlIVcdNl8sE-bij49SsNeqw0N5dkXOVMQCLcBGAs/s1600/how-to-read.jpg)\n\n  \n\n\nToo busy to read? I have a trick that worked for me. Whenever you feel like picking up your phone and browse your feed, pick that book instead. And then you will realize how much time you actually have.\n\n  \n\n\nFor start, you can take inspiration from my reading list:\n\n-   Code Complete\n-   Clean Code\n-   Head First Design Patterns\n-   Hadoop The Definitive Guide\n-   Effective Java\n-   Hadoop in Action\n-   Learning Scala\n-   Hadoop Real World Solutions CookBook\n\nFor a more comprehensive list, you can read [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1711/what-is-the-single-most-influential-book-every-programmer-should-read) thread.\n\n  \n\n\nThat's all for now. Eat right, exercise, and don't drink too much coffee. Try to be the best and you will surely get better and better. Have some excellent tips that you follow? The comments section is all yours!  \n  \n  \n  \n\n",

Use Git</h3>\n<p>Git is an excellent tool for code collaboration. Let’s start with the popular advantages. It offers:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>distributed development,</li>\n<li>feature branching/merging capabilities,</li>\n<li>flexible workflow</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But you can put Git to you immediate uses well!  </p>\n<h4>Git acts as a central repository for all your code.</h4>\n<p>So, you can have a look at your code wherever and whenever you want, as it is always online. I upload most of my personal code at <a href=\"https://github.com/amita-shukla\">Github</a> so that it is easily accessible to me and as well as to the public.</p>\n<h4>Git is useful to keep track of code changes.</h4>\n<p>Git gives you the power to “rewrite history”, so you can see what the changes you made and discard the changes that you no longer want. The git commit history itself acts as a development log.</p>\n<h4>Showcase your code to the world</h4>\n<p>When you write awesome code, what is the point in keeping it hidden? Show Off. There is no better demonstration of a programmer’s work than his code.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OGLGVyt9Zl8/WaA4rjPnVWI/AAAAAAAAGQY/FxAzPedcMaAENIChNkhxOo_C_iHPVOplgCEwYBhgL/s1600/git.png\"><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OGLGVyt9Zl8/WaA4rjPnVWI/AAAAAAAAGQY/FxAzPedcMaAENIChNkhxOo_C_iHPVOplgCEwYBhgL/s320/git.png\"></a></p>\n<p>Beware!

Your Office software can be good enough for this, only if you learn to leverage it properly.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8K18VnEM2aU/WaLZwUrtWuI/AAAAAAAAGRs/RoTEA2IsNk4bbDJQH0jpMBG_mpERnmmWQCLcBGAs/s1600/diagrams.png\"><img src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-8K18VnEM2aU/WaLZwUrtWuI/AAAAAAAAGRs/RoTEA2IsNk4bbDJQH0jpMBG_mpERnmmWQCLcBGAs/s320/diagrams.png\"></a></p>\n<h3></h3>\n<h3>8. Read Code. A lot of Code.</h3>\n<p>Thanks to the open source community, you can read the code that you use.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Knowing the internal design of your code helps you realize if you are using it right.</li>\n<li>Life is short that you can write all the good code out there yourselves. Reading others’ code transfers their knowledge to you. But for that, you not only need to ‘read’, but also understand why something was written that way.</li>\n<li>When you know what your code is doing to its depth, you know its strengths and limitations, and brag about it all, and get the appreciation for the knowledge resource you are! You can thank me later :P</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>9. Make Your Keyboard Your Friend</h3>\n<p>Make sure your fingers know which key to hit in order to type what are you thinking. If you are still looking down while typing, you are not trusting your keyboard enough. If you have been using the same keyboard for quite some time, look up the screen and type. Just the same way you don’t need to figure out how to write when you take notes, you should not think on how to type while coding. It may be obstructive at first, but you won’t realize when you start typing at the speed you are thinking.</p>\n<p>Also, by looking down while typing, you are harming your neck, spine, eyes. Sit straight and type for hours.  </p>\n<h3>10. Document What You Learnt</h3>\n<p>There is one documentation that we all hate writing. But then there can be one another kind of documentation. Your personal one. Make a habit of documenting what all you learned today. How many times it has happened to you that you see a problem and realize that you have done it before but can’t recall it now? You have no option than to do it all over again. Sad.</p>\n<p>Maintaining a personal documentation, or call it a journal, helps you recall quickly the solution to a problem you have already encountered before. Not only this, a day when you feel downright stupid, you can look back at your doc to see the long list of things you have learnt and feel all up!  </p>\n<h3>11. Blog</h3>\n<p>Now that you are maintaining the Journal, if something important pops up. You can go ahead and tell others about it! It also makes you a better presenter. If you can blog about it, you have gained the power to explain it.  </p>\n<h3>12. Read Books.</h3>\n<p>I can’t emphasize this point enough. There are excellent pieces of literature whose knowledge out there that are waiting to be digested by you.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qg88CHCpJB0/WaLfYuH3jSI/AAAAAAAAGR8/AlIVcdNl8sE-bij49SsNeqw0N5dkXOVMQCLcBGAs/s1600/how-to-read.jpg\"><img src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qg88CHCpJB0/WaLfYuH3jSI/AAAAAAAAGR8/AlIVcdNl8sE-bij49SsNeqw0N5dkXOVMQCLcBGAs/s320/how-to-read.jpg\"></a></p>\n<p>Too busy to read?

              "content": "\nIt is said that \"Master the work you do most often\". So if programming is what we do most often, we should definitely come up with practices that help us to master whatever we do, along with learning new skills.  \n  \nHere are a few habits that I follow to make myself more and more efficient as a programmer, gain knowledge and garner appreciation from others!  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oaUVhocsUhM/WaLnXO55xgI/AAAAAAAAGSI/8Cv6X96NPvMv79k1P9tXLQPmiWEIQaOWgCLcBGAs/s320/UPSTART.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oaUVhocsUhM/WaLnXO55xgI/AAAAAAAAGSI/8Cv6X96NPvMv79k1P9tXLQPmiWEIQaOWgCLcBGAs/s1600/UPSTART.png)\n\n  \n  \n\n\n### 1. Use Git\n\nGit is an excellent tool for code collaboration. Let's start with the popular advantages. It offers:  \n\n\n-   distributed development,\n-   feature branching/merging capabilities,\n-   flexible workflow\n\nBut you can put Git to you immediate uses well!  \n\n\n#### Git acts as a central repository for all your code.\n\nSo, you can have a look at your code wherever and whenever you want, as it is always online. I upload most of my personal code at [Github](https://github.com/amita-shukla) so that it is easily accessible to me and as well as to the public.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Git is useful to keep track of code changes.\n\nGit gives you the power to \"rewrite history\", so you can see what the changes you made and discard the changes that you no longer want. The git commit history itself acts as a development log.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Showcase your code to the world\n\nWhen you write awesome code, what is the point in keeping it hidden? Show Off. There is no better demonstration of a programmer's work than his code.  \n  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OGLGVyt9Zl8/WaA4rjPnVWI/AAAAAAAAGQY/FxAzPedcMaAENIChNkhxOo_C_iHPVOplgCEwYBhgL/s320/git.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OGLGVyt9Zl8/WaA4rjPnVWI/AAAAAAAAGQY/FxAzPedcMaAENIChNkhxOo_C_iHPVOplgCEwYBhgL/s1600/git.png)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nBeware! Git is a steep learning curve if you have never tried it before. [Here](http://blog.amitashukla.in/2016/04/how-to-set-up-git-repository.html) is one article to get you started.\n\n  \n\n\n### 2. Learn Regex\n\nQuite often you must have stumbled upon pattern matching. And be it any programming language you use, regex is a tremendously handy tool to do so. It has the power to search through huge texts of code in the most concise way.  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p2_he1Enp7s/WaA4Vemh4pI/AAAAAAAAGQQ/do8lD19dHo4QifGQZNoYIAj0wBwRHagqwCLcBGAs/s320/regex.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-p2_he1Enp7s/WaA4Vemh4pI/AAAAAAAAGQQ/do8lD19dHo4QifGQZNoYIAj0wBwRHagqwCLcBGAs/s1600/regex.png)\n\n  \nHere is the basic regular expression notation:  \n\\[ ] matches a single character contained within the brackets.  \n\\[^ ] matches a single character that is not contained within the brackets.  \n^ matches the first character of the string  \n$ matches the last character of the string  \n\\* matches characters preceding it one or more times  \n  \nThere are several cheat sheets available on the internet, it is useful to keep one bookmarked. [Here](https://www.cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/regular-expressions/) is what I keep with me.  \n  \n\n\n### 3. Create aliases for the commands you use most frequently.\n\nSomeone told me if you have used a command for more than 21 times, create an alias for it.\n\n-   It reduces the amount of typing necessary from long commands. Suppose you need to edit one file regularly, by opening it in an editor. You can create an alias such as:\n\n`alias a=\"gedit /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf\"`  \nThen just type this single letter command and escape from the tedious task.  \n\n\n-   Aliases can be used as a shorthand for some other version of a command that you use more frequently.\n\n`alias ls=\"ls -lrt\"`, or,\n\n`alias hls=\"hadoop fs -ls\"` and so on.\n\n  \n\n\n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p49gjTFJaDs/WaEhP44LWCI/AAAAAAAAGQk/1HILXtDQIqkx52WydZs5s5WEas_ZiRw2QCLcBGAs/s1600/aliases.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-p49gjTFJaDs/WaEhP44LWCI/AAAAAAAAGQk/1HILXtDQIqkx52WydZs5s5WEas_ZiRw2QCLcBGAs/s1600/aliases.png)\n\n  \n\n\nThe problem with aliases is that they are valid only for the current login session. To deal with this, an alias for any user can be added to the_.bashrc_file in that user's[home directory](http://www.linfo.org/home_directory.html). Because this file is read at login, the change will not take effect until the user has logged in again.  \n  \n\n\n### 4. Keep a text editor\n\nWhen we are involved in work, we need some place to keep temporary data, steps of execution or any other random data that we don't want to save but neither to just vanish away when shutting the computer down. And thus having a text editor handy is a plus, be it Notepad++ (it has two plus for a reason), or Sublime Text. Let's discuss some notepad++ features:  \n  \n\n\n-   Multi-tabbed feature that you can create several files at once (double click an empty space beside your current file and you get a new file)\n-   Support for several languages\n-   Syntax highlighting according to the language being used.\n-   Auto completion\n-   Document map etc.\n\n[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k6IpkulQxoU/WaEiy3LJ3uI/AAAAAAAAGQw/XkADFBi2ohYaMZI5moZzGozaXgFI5VD_gCLcBGAs/s1600/notepadpp.jpg)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k6IpkulQxoU/WaEiy3LJ3uI/AAAAAAAAGQw/XkADFBi2ohYaMZI5moZzGozaXgFI5VD_gCLcBGAs/s1600/notepadpp.jpg)\n\n  \nKeep all the clutter out of your mind and on a notepad. Want to remember a set of commands? Note them down. Want to remember some file paths? Note them down. Want to remember execution steps? Note them down. At any later point of time, save these notes and get a raw documentation!  \n  \nFor Linux distributions, make Sublime Text your friend.\n\n  \n\n\nBonus tip: Enter`data:text/html, <html contenteditable>` on your google chrome new tab and convert it into a minimalistic notepad.  \n  \n\n\n### 5. Be Active On StackOverflow\n\n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WKxU88pIUII/WaEl8gtUIVI/AAAAAAAAGQ8/1EWVFVnz0uEOwNOEe-2H5WB9kdZ9E-VigCLcBGAs/s320/so.jpg)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WKxU88pIUII/WaEl8gtUIVI/AAAAAAAAGQ8/1EWVFVnz0uEOwNOEe-2H5WB9kdZ9E-VigCLcBGAs/s1600/so.jpg)\n\n  \nFiring a query on Google, and getting the answer from [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) saves our day (and our career). What we forget is that it is a community run by people like us. And by saying 'being active' I do not mean just anonymously searching the answers to your questions, but creating an account there and actually 'being there' in as many ways possible. But why should you take the burden?  \n  \n\n\n#### It's a give-n-take relationship.\n\nYou get help from other people, and in return, you help other programmers out there. It doesn't take much time, but you will save the time and effort of some other programmer sitting in some other part of the world struggling with the same problem.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Earn Reputation.\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5Jl2Gb8irRw/WaEq4uwjKFI/AAAAAAAAGRM/nYbjzpIyjJsn29g3EileNt6AwwJ4mlWdQCLcBGAs/s1600/so_flair.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5Jl2Gb8irRw/WaEq4uwjKFI/AAAAAAAAGRM/nYbjzpIyjJsn29g3EileNt6AwwJ4mlWdQCLcBGAs/s1600/so_flair.png)\n\n  \n\n\nYour contribution to the community doesn't go in vain. You earn reputation from other programmers who validate your answers and thank you in the form of upvotes termed as 'reputation'. Not only by answering, but even asking the right questions can fetch you reputation. Show it off and earn a high reputation in the real world!\n\n  \n\n\n#### Track yourselves.\n\nOK. This is important. If you do not believe in being 'social', then here is how Stack Overflow can help you. Just be logged in Stack Overflow and you can do a lot more with it. You can mark the questions that you liked as your favourites, or just upvote the answers which helped you. Stack Overflow keeps the record of your activity. Trapped in a situation when you know that the hack to your problem is present in Stack Overflow but can't actually recall it? Just track your activity and dig that question/answer out.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Earn Karma.\n\n\n\n### 6. Keep Linux Commands Handy\n\nThe terminal can be our friend if we know to use its potential to the fullest. Use these to hacks your Linux:  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3lVkUO_0vsg/WaLQskeQJMI/AAAAAAAAGRc/DTk_oTKnwVgVct6BthvBy-kk-6H7dwdxQCLcBGAs/s320/shell.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3lVkUO_0vsg/WaLQskeQJMI/AAAAAAAAGRc/DTk_oTKnwVgVct6BthvBy-kk-6H7dwdxQCLcBGAs/s1600/shell.png)\n\n  \n\n\n#### Tab Completion\n\nNo, no. You don't need to type everything. Just type a letter, and press tab. The tab completion feature completes file names, commands, everything for you.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Pipes\n\nSend the output of one command to another as input using pipes ( | ).  \nOne of the most useful example:  \n`$ ps aux | grep conky | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill`\n\n  \n\n\n#### Wild Cards\n\nThe \\* character – that is, the asterisk – is a wild card that can match anything.  \nFor Example,  \n`rm a*.txt`  \nThis removes all files starting with 'a' that are of .txt format.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Output Redirection\n\n' `>` ' redirects the command output to a file instead of the terminal. This can come handy if you want to save logs of a command in a file.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Launch a command in background using '&'\n\n`firefox &`  \nThis is useful when you want to launch a command but continue using the terminal.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Conditional Execution\n\nYou can have 2 commands run one after the other. Writing a && between the two commands will only execute the 2nd command after the first one successfully executes. For example,  \n`cd /home/user/Documents && ls`  \n\n\n\n\n#### Search and Use the commands from the past\n\nDon't type a command again and again. Press `ctrl+r` and type any key words that you can recall. Shell looks up in the history and finds it for you. Voila!\n\n  \n\n\nThere are so many other tricks out there that an entire post (perhaps a book) can be dedicated to it. Also, a lot more can be done by scripting your long list of commands. I mentioned a few of them in my post [Shell In a Nutshell](http://blog.amitashukla.in/2016/12/shell-in-nutshell.html).  \n  \n\n\n### 7.

So, I went on reading Scala source code. And why not? Scala [claims](https://www.scala-lang.org/what-is-scala.html#functional) to be a full-blown functional language, and allows an easy migration from imperative to functional. It was plain sailing until I stumbled upon List.scala and saw this:  \n  \nThe above length method is used to find the number of elements in a list:  \n\n\n    List(1,2).length\n\nThe length function _iterates_ over the list and increments a len counter until the end of list is reached. Now is there something wrong with this code? Well, nothing. It was just... unexpected. Why? Because it is not functional! See the vars and the while. The length function could have been implemented like this:  \n  \nIt is not that I am against Imperative programming, but this was not something I came looking for.  \n  \n\n\n### With Expectations Come Disappointments. And then Hope.\n\nIn my previous [post](http://blog.amitashukla.in/2017/02/why-functional-programming.html), I discussed why functional programming does not favour iteration, and how [Tail Recursion](http://blog.amitashukla.in/2017/03/tail-recursion-in-functional-programming.html) is the way to overcome the need of iteration. Then why an imperative approach? Well, I researched heavily and got some leads that I will talk about [later](#why_imperative_approach). Now that I felt cheated, I took matters in my own hand.  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bs3U7ItWSLQ/WU06favmttI/AAAAAAAAFZ8/Ms1d1bTYRrATK4wF3TWPGtnW_5pauN3yACLcBGAs/s320/keep-calm-and-do-it-yourself.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bs3U7ItWSLQ/WU06favmttI/AAAAAAAAFZ8/Ms1d1bTYRrATK4wF3TWPGtnW_5pauN3yACLcBGAs/s1600/keep-calm-and-do-it-yourself.png)\n\n  \n  \nAnd so, I, Amita Shukla, decided to implement my very own, MyList! But hey, wait. Just because the list in not implemented the way I want it, I want to implement my own list? Actually, yes. But there are more reasons as well.  \n  \n\n\n-   There are people who go about using data structures (like lists) without ever, ever implementing them. But the real thrill is in implementing one. And a linked list is the simplest one to start with.\n-   I have implemented linked list in [C](https://github.com/amita-shukla/programs/blob/master/TurboCFiles/CREATE_L.CPP) and [Java](https://github.com/amita-shukla/programs/blob/master/LinkedList.java) before, so it would be great to do the same in Scala. That would let me understand the philosophy behind each kind of implementation, and also, the syntactical differences between the languages.\n-   Reading Scala's List can be overwhelming. Scala's List is one of the most used classes in the language, and is power packed with functionality. It is abstract, covariant, has companion objects, implements classes/traits such as AbstractSeq, LinearSeq, Product, GenericTraversableTemplate, LinearSeqOptimised... It can be difficult to digest all in one go.\n-   Implementing List gives a better idea of the relative efficiency of list operations, which will help us to write fast and compact code using lists.\n\n### The Road Map\n\nBefore coding anything, let's ponder over what exactly are we going to make. Here is how we will be making our way ahead:  \n  \n\n\n-   [Determine the type of List to use (LinkedList v/s ArrayList)](#list_type)\n-   [Design the basic layout of MyList](#basic_list_layout)\n-   -   [Covariance](#covariance)\n    -   [Singleton Object](#object)\n    -   [Case classes](#case_class)\n-   Add methods to MyList\n-   -   [Take covariance further using add](#add)\n    -   [Pattern Matching with last](#last)\n    -   [Transform a list using map](#map)\n    -   [Understand foldLeft and Currying](#foldleft)\n    -   [Filter a list](#filter)\n-   [Some Afterthoughts](#footnotes)\n-   -   [The equivalence of MyList to scala.List](#similarities)\n    -   [The differences](#differences)\n    -   [Why List is the way it is](#why_imperative_approach)\n\n### Why is Scala List a 'LinkedList'?\n\nFundamentally, a linked list is a chain of nodes each referring to exactly one other node until you reach the end of the chain. Lists preserve order, can contain duplicates, can insert, remove elements in constant time (the first element, of course).  \n\n\n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gjXJzX72dqs/WU_NPI74VcI/AAAAAAAAFbw/TqWvlBrtSF8CIjC7kYbd2rPsiPPwGxDdgCLcBGAs/s320/linked-list.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gjXJzX72dqs/WU_NPI74VcI/AAAAAAAAFbw/TqWvlBrtSF8CIjC7kYbd2rPsiPPwGxDdgCLcBGAs/s1600/linked-list.png)\n\n  \nLinked List enables to make Scala's list **immutable**. Why immutable? I discussed the need of immutability in my post [Going The Functional](http://blog.amitashukla.in/2017/02/why-functional-programming.html)[Way](http://blog.amitashukla.in/2017/02/why-functional-programming.html). In short, we can say that immutability lets you write a code that is free of side effects.  \n  \nA list has simulated operations as add or update or remove, these operations in each case return a new collection and leave the old collection unchanged. Hence, we can rely on the fact that accessing the same collection value repeatedly at different points in time will always yield a collection with the same elements.  \nWe can try something similar to java.util.ArrayList, but then it can not be immutable.  \n  \n\n\n### Back to the drawing board...\n\nOur list should be able to hold a piece of data (let's call it `head`), point to the rest of the list (let's call it `tail`) and indicate if it is empty (a boolean variable `isEmpty`). So, all list operations can be defined in terms of these three operations:  \n  \n`MyList[A]` defines a generic list. The term generic means we can define many specific types with one generically written class. For example, a list can be `MyList[String]`, `MyList[Int]` etc. If `MyList` is of type `A`, then the `head` is of type `A` and the `tail` is of type `MyList[A]`.  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Tbku9YpHBY4/WU5QZmDZ7OI/AAAAAAAAFao/tKMotw8lQaE_dYTM09DgsLVgMwZA7j2KACLcBGAs/s1600/MyList.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Tbku9YpHBY4/WU5QZmDZ7OI/AAAAAAAAFao/tKMotw8lQaE_dYTM09DgsLVgMwZA7j2KACLcBGAs/s1600/MyList.png)\n\n  \nHowever, this list doesn't suggest a way to indicate the end of the list. At first, it may occur to assign the `head` and the `tail` as `null`. But `null` has drawbacks associated with it (say, `NullPointerException` ). So, we need each node of the list to be either of the two types:  \n\n\n-   An object to mark the end of a list, let's say, `MyEmptyList`\n-   And a regular class to mark all the other nodes, let's say, `MyNonEmptyList`.\n\nAnd therefore, our list should be abstract: so that we cannot instantiate `MyList` by calling an empty constructor. By making the list abstract, we can now instantiate a list only in terms of either `MyEmptyList` or `MyNonEmptyList`.  \n  \n\n\nWe have a bunch of concepts here.  \n\n\n### Covariance\n\n`MyList` has a type parameter `A`. What does the `+` sign in front of it mean? In formal terms, A plus sign means that values of type A appear in **covariant** (+) position. In simpler terms, it means a list can also take the subtypes of A. A covariant position indicates that the type A always occurs as the output or return type. A `MyList[A]` is a subtype of a `MyList[B]`, if `A` is a sub-type of `B` (i.e. `A <: B`).  \n  \n\n\nSee? If we try to add a Cat to a list of Dogs, then the resulting list is a list of Animal. Covariance enables the compiler to find the suitable super type for all the type of objects inserted in a list. The implementation of the add method is discussed [later](#add).  \n  \nWe have applied the same concept for declaring the `MyEmptyList` as `MyList[Nothing]`. `Nothing` is the bottom-most type in Scala, a type that is the sub-type of any other type. We can thus have object `MyEmptyList` extending `MyList[Nothing]`, and thereby `MyEmptyList` becoming the sub-type of `MyList[A]` for any possible `A`. Whenever we need a list, no matter what the element type, we can use `MyEmptyList`.  \n\n\n### Object MyEmptyList\n\nThe `MyEmptyList` is not a class but a **Singleton object**.Unlike Java, there is no static keyword in Scala, instead, we have singleton object. We use an object here to define a single-use class for marking the end of the list.  \n  \nThe value of `isEmpty` in the `MyEmptyList` is always true (well, obviously) and it is not supposed to have a `head` element or a `tail`. The `MyEmptyList` extends from `MyList` of type `Nothing`, which is the bottom most type of all types. This gives the best of both worlds: it is used to signal the lack of value and still be type-safe. As discussed before, that is the reason we have `MyList[+A]` instead of `MyList[A]`, because we accept objects of type `A` and it's subtypes (`Nothing`).  \n\n\n### Case Class MyNonEmptyList\n\nThe MyNonEmptyList is a **case class**. What is a case class? With case class, you can define the primary constructor as part of the class declaration itself. So what is the constructor we are talking about here? Take a look:  \n  \nThis is cool as it allows us to force the user to parameterize the `MyNonEmptyList` with a `head` and a `tail` for instantiation. Obviously, a non-empty list must have a head and a tail. We use case class here because they let us magically perform Pattern Matching, as we will see [later](#last).  \n  \n\n\n### It's Time for Action!\n\nNow that we have our structure defined, we can add some functionalities in our MyList class.  \n\n\n#### Add an element to a list\n\nThe most basic function would be the ability to add an element to a list. It can be done as:  \n  \n\n\nAs explained in the covariance section, adding an element of a different type allows the compiler to return the list of the nearest common super type. Also, observe that the add function adds an element to the front of the list and not to the end, as adding to front takes O(1) time whereas adding to last takes O(n) time for linked lists.  \n\n\n#### Finding the last element of a list\n\nNow let us start with some pattern matching magic! Suppose we have to write a function to return the last element of a list:\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nWhat is pattern matching here? Pattern matching is a mechanism for checking a value against a pattern. It is a more powerful version of the switch statement in Java. Its best use is Case Classes, as you see in the above implementation. The head and tail of a MyNonEmptyList can be used in the case body.  \n  \nThough Pattern Matching can be used to deconstruct complex structures and can be used in place of if-else statements, the compiler generates a lot of code under the hood if pattern matching is used for booleans.  \n  \n\n\n#### Mapping a List\n\nThe map applies the function passed to it to convert each element of the list into a different value or type. It is really simple to implement:\n\n  \n\n\nA map is a useful function as it can be used for list transformations. Let's have a look at another such important function: `foldLeft`.  \n\n\n#### FoldLeft\n\nThe signature of the foldLeft function is as follows:  \nfoldLeft\\[B](z:B)(f: (B,A)=>B):B  \nThe foldLeft function goes through the whole List, from head to tail, and passes each value to f. For the first list item, that first parameter, z, is used as the first parameter to f. For the second list item, the result of the first call to f is used as the B type parameter.  \n  \n  \n\n\nThe `foldleft`has a 'left' in it as it operates by taking elements of a list from left to right. Why is this important? Because there can be functions which output different result depending on whether the order of operands (e.g. divide operation, log function etc).\n\nThe foldLeft method is a **curried** function. In simple terms, it just means that it accepts two arguments in separate parentheses instead of one.  \n\n\n#### Filter\n\nA filter is a function that drops those elements of the list which do not satisfy a given condition.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nSo far, we have implemented the functions add, last, map, foldLeft, filter. There are many more functions in the original Scala List that we can implement in a functional way. However, there are some points that we should keep in mind.  \n\n\n### Foot Notes\n\n-   Remember that all the operations are on immutable lists, i.e. they return a new list every time they are called and do not modify the original list.\n-   The scala.List has a similar structure with a few differences. The `MyEmptyList` discussed here is similar to the object `Nil`, and `MyNonEmptyList` is equivalent to the class `::` (pronounced as 'cons'). In Scala, the special properties of any method-name ending with `:` is that it makes the operation right-associative. Therefore, `MyNonEmptyList(head,tail)` can be written as `tail.::head` or `head :: tail` .\n-   Not all functions in `MyList` are as efficient as they can be. As I discussed in my post about [Tail Recursion](http://blog.amitashukla.in/2017/03/tail-recursion-in-functional-programming.html), functions can be made tail recursive for efficiency. Let's take the simplest example, `length`:\n-   Why imperative approach for scala.List? [This](http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/implementing-lists.html#22.4) discussion, by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners talks about why imperative implementation was used for immutable list implementation. Also worth reading is [this](http://debasishg.blogspot.in/2008/10/to-tail-recurse-or-not.html) article by Debasish Ghosh, where he talks about localized mutation to achieve performance, instead of a functional implementation of map function in Scala.\n\nThere can be lot more refinements possible, but taking the first step is a feat in itself. The complete code is available on Github [here](https://github.com/amita-shukla/functional-programming/blob/master/FunctionalList/src/com/amitashukla/test.sc). We have worked on a lot of elements, which are important constructs when doing functional programming and working with Scala in general. A lot can be taken further though. Stay tuned!\n",

So, I went on reading Scala source code. And why not? Scala <a href=\"https://www.scala-lang.org/what-is-scala.html#functional\">claims</a> to be a full-blown functional language, and allows an easy migration from imperative to functional. It was plain sailing until I stumbled upon List.scala and saw this:  </p>\n<p>The above length method is used to find the number of elements in a list:  </p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">List(1,2).length</code></pre></div>\n<p>The length function <em>iterates</em> over the list and increments a len counter until the end of list is reached. Now is there something wrong with this code? Well, nothing. It was just… unexpected. Why? Because it is not functional! See the vars and the while. The length function could have been implemented like this:  </p>\n<p>It is not that I am against Imperative programming, but this was not something I came looking for.  </p>\n<h3>With Expectations Come Disappointments. And then Hope.</h3>\n<p>In my previous <a href=\"http://blog.amitashukla.in/2017/02/why-functional-programming.html\">post</a>, I discussed why functional programming does not favour iteration, and how <a href=\"http://blog.amitashukla.in/2017/03/tail-recursion-in-functional-programming.html\">Tail Recursion</a> is the way to overcome the need of iteration. Then why an imperative approach? Well, I researched heavily and got some leads that I will talk about <a href=\"#why_imperative_approach\">later</a>. Now that I felt cheated, I took matters in my own hand.  </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bs3U7ItWSLQ/WU06favmttI/AAAAAAAAFZ8/Ms1d1bTYRrATK4wF3TWPGtnW_5pauN3yACLcBGAs/s1600/keep-calm-and-do-it-yourself.png\"><img src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bs3U7ItWSLQ/WU06favmttI/AAAAAAAAFZ8/Ms1d1bTYRrATK4wF3TWPGtnW_5pauN3yACLcBGAs/s320/keep-calm-and-do-it-yourself.png\"></a></p>\n<p>And so, I, Amita Shukla, decided to implement my very own, MyList! But hey, wait. Just because the list in not implemented the way I want it, I want to implement my own list? Actually, yes. But there are more reasons as well.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are people who go about using data structures (like lists) without ever, ever implementing them. But the real thrill is in implementing one. And a linked list is the simplest one to start with.</li>\n<li>I have implemented linked list in <a href=\"https://github.com/amita-shukla/programs/blob/master/TurboCFiles/CREATE_L.CPP\">C</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/amita-shukla/programs/blob/master/LinkedList.java\">Java</a> before, so it would be great to do the same in Scala. That would let me understand the philosophy behind each kind of implementation, and also, the syntactical differences between the languages.</li>\n<li>Reading Scala’s List can be overwhelming. Scala’s List is one of the most used classes in the language, and is power packed with functionality. It is abstract, covariant, has companion objects, implements classes/traits such as AbstractSeq, LinearSeq, Product, GenericTraversableTemplate, LinearSeqOptimised… It can be difficult to digest all in one go.</li>\n<li>Implementing List gives a better idea of the relative efficiency of list operations, which will help us to write fast and compact code using lists.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>The Road Map</h3>\n<p>Before coding anything, let’s ponder over what exactly are we going to make.

Now is there something wrong with this code? Well, nothing. It was just... unexpected. Why? Because it is not functional! See the vars and the while. The length function could have been implemented like this:  \n  \nIt is not that I am against Imperative programming, but this was not something I came looking for.  \n  \n\n\n### With Expectations Come Disappointments. And then Hope.\n\nIn my previous [post](http://blog.amitashukla.in/2017/02/why-functional-programming.html), I discussed why functional programming does not favour iteration, and how [Tail Recursion](http://blog.amitashukla.in/2017/03/tail-recursion-in-functional-programming.html) is the way to overcome the need of iteration. Then why an imperative approach? Well, I researched heavily and got some leads that I will talk about [later](#why_imperative_approach). Now that I felt cheated, I took matters in my own hand.  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bs3U7ItWSLQ/WU06favmttI/AAAAAAAAFZ8/Ms1d1bTYRrATK4wF3TWPGtnW_5pauN3yACLcBGAs/s320/keep-calm-and-do-it-yourself.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-bs3U7ItWSLQ/WU06favmttI/AAAAAAAAFZ8/Ms1d1bTYRrATK4wF3TWPGtnW_5pauN3yACLcBGAs/s1600/keep-calm-and-do-it-yourself.png)\n\n  \n  \nAnd so, I, Amita Shukla, decided to implement my very own, MyList! But hey, wait. Just because the list in not implemented the way I want it, I want to implement my own list? Actually, yes. But there are more reasons as well.  \n  \n\n\n-   There are people who go about using data structures (like lists) without ever, ever implementing them. But the real thrill is in implementing one. And a linked list is the simplest one to start with.\n-   I have implemented linked list in [C](https://github.com/amita-shukla/programs/blob/master/TurboCFiles/CREATE_L.CPP) and [Java](https://github.com/amita-shukla/programs/blob/master/LinkedList.java) before, so it would be great to do the same in Scala. That would let me understand the philosophy behind each kind of implementation, and also, the syntactical differences between the languages.\n-   Reading Scala's List can be overwhelming. Scala's List is one of the most used classes in the language, and is power packed with functionality. It is abstract, covariant, has companion objects, implements classes/traits such as AbstractSeq, LinearSeq, Product, GenericTraversableTemplate, LinearSeqOptimised... It can be difficult to digest all in one go.\n-   Implementing List gives a better idea of the relative efficiency of list operations, which will help us to write fast and compact code using lists.\n\n### The Road Map\n\nBefore coding anything, let's ponder over what exactly are we going to make. Here is how we will be making our way ahead:  \n  \n\n\n-   [Determine the type of List to use (LinkedList v/s ArrayList)](#list_type)\n-   [Design the basic layout of MyList](#basic_list_layout)\n-   -   [Covariance](#covariance)\n    -   [Singleton Object](#object)\n    -   [Case classes](#case_class)\n-   Add methods to MyList\n-   -   [Take covariance further using add](#add)\n    -   [Pattern Matching with last](#last)\n    -   [Transform a list using map](#map)\n    -   [Understand foldLeft and Currying](#foldleft)\n    -   [Filter a list](#filter)\n-   [Some Afterthoughts](#footnotes)\n-   -   [The equivalence of MyList to scala.List](#similarities)\n    -   [The differences](#differences)\n    -   [Why List is the way it is](#why_imperative_approach)\n\n### Why is Scala List a 'LinkedList'?\n\nFundamentally, a linked list is a chain of nodes each referring to exactly one other node until you reach the end of the chain. Lists preserve order, can contain duplicates, can insert, remove elements in constant time (the first element, of course).  \n\n\n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gjXJzX72dqs/WU_NPI74VcI/AAAAAAAAFbw/TqWvlBrtSF8CIjC7kYbd2rPsiPPwGxDdgCLcBGAs/s320/linked-list.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gjXJzX72dqs/WU_NPI74VcI/AAAAAAAAFbw/TqWvlBrtSF8CIjC7kYbd2rPsiPPwGxDdgCLcBGAs/s1600/linked-list.png)\n\n  \nLinked List enables to make Scala's list **immutable**. Why immutable? I discussed the need of immutability in my post [Going The Functional](http://blog.amitashukla.in/2017/02/why-functional-programming.html)[Way](http://blog.amitashukla.in/2017/02/why-functional-programming.html). In short, we can say that immutability lets you write a code that is free of side effects.  \n  \nA list has simulated operations as add or update or remove, these operations in each case return a new collection and leave the old collection unchanged. Hence, we can rely on the fact that accessing the same collection value repeatedly at different points in time will always yield a collection with the same elements.  \nWe can try something similar to java.util.ArrayList, but then it can not be immutable.  \n  \n\n\n### Back to the drawing board...\n\nOur list should be able to hold a piece of data (let's call it `head`), point to the rest of the list (let's call it `tail`) and indicate if it is empty (a boolean variable `isEmpty`). So, all list operations can be defined in terms of these three operations:  \n  \n`MyList[A]` defines a generic list. The term generic means we can define many specific types with one generically written class. For example, a list can be `MyList[String]`, `MyList[Int]` etc. If `MyList` is of type `A`, then the `head` is of type `A` and the `tail` is of type `MyList[A]`.  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Tbku9YpHBY4/WU5QZmDZ7OI/AAAAAAAAFao/tKMotw8lQaE_dYTM09DgsLVgMwZA7j2KACLcBGAs/s1600/MyList.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Tbku9YpHBY4/WU5QZmDZ7OI/AAAAAAAAFao/tKMotw8lQaE_dYTM09DgsLVgMwZA7j2KACLcBGAs/s1600/MyList.png)\n\n  \nHowever, this list doesn't suggest a way to indicate the end of the list. At first, it may occur to assign the `head` and the `tail` as `null`. But `null` has drawbacks associated with it (say, `NullPointerException` ). So, we need each node of the list to be either of the two types:  \n\n\n-   An object to mark the end of a list, let's say, `MyEmptyList`\n-   And a regular class to mark all the other nodes, let's say, `MyNonEmptyList`.\n\nAnd therefore, our list should be abstract: so that we cannot instantiate `MyList` by calling an empty constructor. By making the list abstract, we can now instantiate a list only in terms of either `MyEmptyList` or `MyNonEmptyList`.  \n  \n\n\nWe have a bunch of concepts here.  \n\n\n### Covariance\n\n`MyList` has a type parameter `A`. What does the `+` sign in front of it mean? In formal terms, A plus sign means that values of type A appear in **covariant** (+) position. In simpler terms, it means a list can also take the subtypes of A. A covariant position indicates that the type A always occurs as the output or return type. A `MyList[A]` is a subtype of a `MyList[B]`, if `A` is a sub-type of `B` (i.e. `A <: B`).  \n  \n\n\nSee? If we try to add a Cat to a list of Dogs, then the resulting list is a list of Animal. Covariance enables the compiler to find the suitable super type for all the type of objects inserted in a list. The implementation of the add method is discussed [later](#add).  \n  \nWe have applied the same concept for declaring the `MyEmptyList` as `MyList[Nothing]`. `Nothing` is the bottom-most type in Scala, a type that is the sub-type of any other type. We can thus have object `MyEmptyList` extending `MyList[Nothing]`, and thereby `MyEmptyList` becoming the sub-type of `MyList[A]` for any possible `A`. Whenever we need a list, no matter what the element type, we can use `MyEmptyList`.  \n\n\n### Object MyEmptyList\n\nThe `MyEmptyList` is not a class but a **Singleton object**.Unlike Java, there is no static keyword in Scala, instead, we have singleton object. We use an object here to define a single-use class for marking the end of the list.  \n  \nThe value of `isEmpty` in the `MyEmptyList` is always true (well, obviously) and it is not supposed to have a `head` element or a `tail`. The `MyEmptyList` extends from `MyList` of type `Nothing`, which is the bottom most type of all types. This gives the best of both worlds: it is used to signal the lack of value and still be type-safe. As discussed before, that is the reason we have `MyList[+A]` instead of `MyList[A]`, because we accept objects of type `A` and it's subtypes (`Nothing`).  \n\n\n### Case Class MyNonEmptyList\n\nThe MyNonEmptyList is a **case class**. What is a case class? With case class, you can define the primary constructor as part of the class declaration itself. So what is the constructor we are talking about here? Take a look:  \n  \nThis is cool as it allows us to force the user to parameterize the `MyNonEmptyList` with a `head` and a `tail` for instantiation. Obviously, a non-empty list must have a head and a tail. We use case class here because they let us magically perform Pattern Matching, as we will see [later](#last).  \n  \n\n\n### It's Time for Action!\n\nNow that we have our structure defined, we can add some functionalities in our MyList class.  \n\n\n#### Add an element to a list\n\nThe most basic function would be the ability to add an element to a list. It can be done as:  \n  \n\n\nAs explained in the covariance section, adding an element of a different type allows the compiler to return the list of the nearest common super type. Also, observe that the add function adds an element to the front of the list and not to the end, as adding to front takes O(1) time whereas adding to last takes O(n) time for linked lists.  \n\n\n#### Finding the last element of a list\n\nNow let us start with some pattern matching magic! Suppose we have to write a function to return the last element of a list:\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nWhat is pattern matching here? Pattern matching is a mechanism for checking a value against a pattern. It is a more powerful version of the switch statement in Java. Its best use is Case Classes, as you see in the above implementation. The head and tail of a MyNonEmptyList can be used in the case body.  \n  \nThough Pattern Matching can be used to deconstruct complex structures and can be used in place of if-else statements, the compiler generates a lot of code under the hood if pattern matching is used for booleans.  \n  \n\n\n#### Mapping a List\n\nThe map applies the function passed to it to convert each element of the list into a different value or type. It is really simple to implement:\n\n  \n\n\nA map is a useful function as it can be used for list transformations. Let's have a look at another such important function: `foldLeft`.  \n\n\n#### FoldLeft\n\nThe signature of the foldLeft function is as follows:  \nfoldLeft\\[B](z:B)(f: (B,A)=>B):B  \nThe foldLeft function goes through the whole List, from head to tail, and passes each value to f. For the first list item, that first parameter, z, is used as the first parameter to f. For the second list item, the result of the first call to f is used as the B type parameter.  \n  \n  \n\n\nThe `foldleft`has a 'left' in it as it operates by taking elements of a list from left to right. Why is this important? Because there can be functions which output different result depending on whether the order of operands (e.g. divide operation, log function etc).\n\nThe foldLeft method is a **curried** function. In simple terms, it just means that it accepts two arguments in separate parentheses instead of one.  \n\n\n#### Filter\n\nA filter is a function that drops those elements of the list which do not satisfy a given condition.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nSo far, we have implemented the functions add, last, map, foldLeft, filter. There are many more functions in the original Scala List that we can implement in a functional way. However, there are some points that we should keep in mind.  \n\n\n### Foot Notes\n\n-   Remember that all the operations are on immutable lists, i.e. they return a new list every time they are called and do not modify the original list.\n-   The scala.List has a similar structure with a few differences. The `MyEmptyList` discussed here is similar to the object `Nil`, and `MyNonEmptyList` is equivalent to the class `::` (pronounced as 'cons'). In Scala, the special properties of any method-name ending with `:` is that it makes the operation right-associative. Therefore, `MyNonEmptyList(head,tail)` can be written as `tail.::head` or `head :: tail` .\n-   Not all functions in `MyList` are as efficient as they can be. As I discussed in my post about [Tail Recursion](http://blog.amitashukla.in/2017/03/tail-recursion-in-functional-programming.html), functions can be made tail recursive for efficiency. Let's take the simplest example, `length`:\n-   Why imperative approach for scala.List? [This](http://www.artima.com/pins1ed/implementing-lists.html#22.4) discussion, by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, and Bill Venners talks about why imperative implementation was used for immutable list implementation. Also worth reading is [this](http://debasishg.blogspot.in/2008/10/to-tail-recurse-or-not.html) article by Debasish Ghosh, where he talks about localized mutation to achieve performance, instead of a functional implementation of map function in Scala.\n\nThere can be lot more refinements possible, but taking the first step is a feat in itself. The complete code is available on Github [here](https://github.com/amita-shukla/functional-programming/blob/master/FunctionalList/src/com/amitashukla/test.sc). We have worked on a lot of elements, which are important constructs when doing functional programming and working with Scala in general. A lot can be taken further though. Stay tuned!\n"

First Java code is the Imperative style whereas the second Scala code is the Functional Style. At first I thought it is just another way of looking through a problem, but looks like it's a lot more than that. Functional Style uses Recursion a lot. A hell lot.  \n  \nBut why?  \nThe first code looks so simple. You iterate through a loop, multiply the number with one less that it, until you reach 0. Looping has always been easy to learn. Moreover, it is always more intuitive to go by the 'loop' way - they are heavily embedded in our lives (if you are an Imperative programmer!) and we can't imagine a problem without loops.  \nAnother reason - Java has accommodated iteration seamlessly for us. There are for loops, while loops, foreach, do-while (yes, they exist.), Iterators, ResultSet...  \n  \nLook at the second code now. There is a function in a function (Oh! it's 'functional' programming by the way), the outer function does nothing other than calling another function defined within it with an extra parameter, the inner function computes factorial recursively. Even if we manage to understand the hierarchy of the code, the fact that it is recursive makes it difficult to understand. You need to keep in mind the previous stack while calculating the present stack.  \n  \n\n\n### Why Favour Recursion over Iteration?\n\nYes we know it - Recursion is bad for a code's health. For any given large number, recursion can get costly on memory. It is because the memory has to keep track of variables used in each cycle of recursion.\n\nConsider a recursive function to calculate factorial in java:\n\nThis code, though may be intuitive, can result in memory and performance related issues.  \n  \n\n\n### What stops Functional Programming from adopting Iteration?\n\nIn functional programming, iteration conflicts with the basic principle of functional programming:  \n\n\n> _\"Functions do not have side-effects.\"_\n\nConsidering the fact that a function does not produce side effects, a loop can also be considered as a function - given the number and a number as the counter. The value of this counter is supposed to change (decrease by 1, in this case) by each call to this function. However, this is not the desired effect: the result of the loop function depends on the number of times it has been called, a _side-effect._This leaves us to use recursion.  \n  \n\n\n### How Functional Programming deals with Recursion Related issues?\n\nIn functional programming, we use a trick known as Tail Recursion to overcome the implementation issues related with recursion.  \n_Tail Recursion is a form of recursion, in which the recursive call is the last action in the function._  \n  \nTail recursion has an inherent advantage: when the recursive call is the last call, then it gives the compiler the freedom to reuse the stack. This is because, in case of tail recursion, once a recursive call is made, no variable is used later. Hence, the variables can be forgotten and the stack can be reused for a fresh set of variables.  \n  \nIn general, if the last action of a function consists of calling another function ( which may be itself), one stack frame would be sufficient for both functions. Such calls are called _tail-calls_.  \n  \n_The above reason makes Tail Recursion equivalent to Iteration._  \n  \n\n\n### How To Make Your Function Tail Recursive?\n\nGiven the reason that a function is written recursively, how can we approach a solution to a problem in a tail-recursive way?\n\n#### Accumulator\n\nFunctional Programming gives us the freedom to define a function inside a function. Hence, we can create another function called 'loop', which takes up an extra parameter called `acc`. This variable, as its name suggests, is used to 'accumulate' the result over multiple recursive calls.  \n  \n\n\nThe original function is used to call the helper function, supplying it with the initial value of the accumulator. We keep the outer function to maintain the signature of the factorial function, so that the user is not affected by the implementation side of it.  \n  \n\n\n### How to indicate the Compiler for Tail Recursion?\n\nIn Scala, only directly recursive calls to the current function are optimised by the compiler to be used in a way equivalent to that of Iteration. One can require that a function is tail recursive by using the annotation `@tailrec`\n\n  \nI hope now the not-so-intuitive-functional-code starts to make sense.  \nA side - effect free language, though seems to have adopted complex ways, unfolds into really simple version as we get used to it. Let's see what all it has for us!\n",

            "rawMarkdownBody": "\n2016 ended with me struggling to solve Scala assignments on Coursera. It was a mind-twisting experience, as I was accustomed to writing Java code. My [first assignment](https://github.com/amita-shukla/functional-programming) was on the topic Recursion, was a set of three problems, printing the Pascal's Triangle, checking balanced parenthesis, and change given the money. I had practised all these problems, but in Java. Doing these problems in functional programming was baffling, as it has an entirely different approach to solving problems.  \n  \nBut I wondered, why did I decide functional programming in the first place?  \n  \n\n\n### Functional Programming Makes You Look At Things Differently.\n\nFunctional programming was the answer to the question, \"What next?\" Even when you have spent sufficient time on programming, going the functional way made me an amateur again. I recalled my initial days in school, when I was given a problem and I just didn't know what to do next. Same happened here, it brought down my confidence on programming, only to achieve a new sense of confidence, a more humble one. It was the same as doing Mathematics : It is always better to solve a problem in more than one way.\n\n  \n\n\n### When You Have A Big Data Job, You Should Know Its Roots.\n\nI went through [this](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2006/08/01/can-your-programming-language-do-this/) blog post ( I was later binge reading this blog, [Joel On Software](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/)), I realized that it was functional programming where the functions Map and Reduce were first used. I was reading a lot about Hadoop and Map Reduce before this, but nowhere I could relate all that. I decided that let's think about the Map Reduce in the way its creators thought about it. The Functional Way.\n\n  \n\n\n### A More Concise, Cleaner Code\n\nAs I went on reading code written by my colleagues in Scala, I realized that the same code in Java would have added a lot of boilerplate code. Scala was a much cleaner alternative. Though there are other languages that are more concise than Java (Python?), Scala was different. It was a mix of [Functional and Object-Oriented](https://www.scala-lang.org/).  \n  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lsl1fJzasZ8/WJnHJPEqpQI/AAAAAAAAFR0/z0Gvp491Cx44Bk1njFAfBb4MCe5YuqG2ACLcB/s1600/FP.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Lsl1fJzasZ8/WJnHJPEqpQI/AAAAAAAAFR0/z0Gvp491Cx44Bk1njFAfBb4MCe5YuqG2ACLcB/s1600/FP.png)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n### Functional Is The Way For Concurrency\n\nTo handle a huge amount of data, you take up chunks of data to handle them separately, without interacting with each other. Imperative Programming provides multi-threading of course, but we need to use them with extra care. Any thread that causes changes outside of what it is supposed to do (known as Side-Effects), it can crash the whole application. These side effects can cause threads to get entangled together (Ouch!)... and then you handle them with abstractions using locks, etc.\n\n  \n\n\nFunctional Programming, on the other hand, forces you to write side-effect free functions. And therefore, you can run these functions in any order. In this way, it becomes very simple to enable concurrency.\n\n  \n\n\n### Time v/s Space\n\nMartin Odersky, the creator of Scala, talks about the difference of time-space approach while working on the imperative or functional approach to programming.\n\nWhen we think of a time based approach, we write the code in the form of time-based steps, happening one after the other. Whereas, the functional approach guides to perform manipulation on data, making chunks, processing those chunks... this approach is space oriented.\n\nFor concurrency related problems, programming the time-based approach is more complicated as compared to the space-based approach.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \nThere is a lot more to discuss, but I would prefer to code some of it and then write about my experiences...\n",

But there are many, many other requirements that just cannot be fulfilled by that. Dealing with text data comes with its challenges...  \n\n\n  \n\n\n### Hey, why don't you text me?\n\n#### Delimiters.\n\nThe delimiters give a hard time. When you have huge data to handle (we are talking about Big Data here), storing them as text files means we need to define a character that separates the data into columns and rows. But what if this special character is a part of the data itself? So, if you think that ^ is a character that is highly unlikely to occur in the data, you will most probably encounter it in the next batch! You do need data munging to make sure the data doesn't get messed up.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Performance.\n\nBeing Selective, suppose you have a huge dataset and you wish to query a small part of it. Let's say you write a query in Hive. But to answer your query on text data, hive now needs to read the whole data set until it finds the result. This incurs performance penalties.\n\n  \n\n\n### Column Oriented Formats\n\nThen comes this thing called Column Oriented Formats. According to Tom White in Hadoop The Definitive Guide :\n\n_A column-oriented layout permits columns that are not accessed in a query to be skipped._\n\n_  \n_\n\nSo, if I need to read a single columns only, then also the whole row is loaded into the memory. But with column oriented formats you can escape that. Hence, it gives you performance benefits when we need to fire queries involving only a small number of columns.\n\nColumn oriented formats need to maintain row splits in buffer, hence they need memory for reading and writing purposes.\n\n  \n\n\n### ORC File Format\n\nFirst thing first, ORC stands for Optimised Row Columnar. ORC is under the project Apache Hive, is used to efficiently store Hive data.It offers excellent compression ratios through the use of Run length encoding. Data stored in ORC format can be read through HCatalog so any Pig or MapReduce program can work with ORC format seamlessly.\n\n  \n\n\n### Writing ORC using MapReduce\n\nORC files can be written using Java MapReduce. For this, we need a Mapper class and a driver class.\n\n  \n\n\nLet us suppose we have data stored in the form of text files, in HDFS. We need to migrate that data to a hive table storing it in ORC format.\n\n  \n\n\nConsider the data first:\n\n  \nNow, it's time to write the mapper.  \n  \nThe mapper contains two methods, `setup()`and `map()`.  \nThe `setup()` method contains the code that is run once for all the instances of `map()` that are launched. The ORC Serde requires to specify the type string - A string that specifies the column name and the corresponding data types. Next, I create a `mapping` object, a mapping between columns and their datatypes. This mapping is used in the `map()` method later.  \n  \nThe `map()` method contains the code to read each line, process it, and write it in ORC format at the specified location. But, as seen from the signature, each line comes in `Text` format. For storing the data in respective data types, we spilt the line into columns and parse the data type according to the `mapping` object using the method `buildList()`. The `buildList()` method returns a list of objects, i.e. the parsed data in its respective data type.  \n  \nThe Driver class for calling the mapper is written like this:  \n  \n  \nThe method `setNumReduceTasks()` sets the number of reducers to 0. This is an indication that the output of the mapper goes as the final output. The input and the output path are taken as the arguments. For writing in ORC, we set the output key as `NullWritable` and output value as `Writable.`  \n\n\nLet me now provide other POJOs used here :  \n  \n  \n  \nIn the above method `buildList()`, I have caught the exception instead of throwing it so that the mapper doesn't stop entirely if the data is not according to its expected datatype (Suppose a null value).  \n  \nFor running the application, export the class files in a jar archive, and then execute the hadoop jar command, providing the input and output HDFS locations: However, here it is important to export the `HADOOP_CLASSPATH`. Also, all external jars needed, like here, I included the hive jars under the libjars option.  \n\n\n\n    $ classpath=`echo /usr/lib/hive/lib/* | sed  's/ /:/g'`\n    $ export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=\"$classpath\"\n    $ libjars=`echo /usr/lib/hive/lib/* | sed 's/ /,/g'`\n    $ hadoop jar ORCWriter.jar FileMapperDriver -libjars $libjars /user/cloudera/in /user/cloudera/output \n",

I am working on automation of my project in office, and it involved a lot of SHELL scripting. Oh yes, you got it now. Please don't kill me.\n\n  \n\n\n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9iag99Llw-M/WEaLilMFRRI/AAAAAAAAFPM/73BBEPdmUroYGnCtAKbbw_v9jVKvXWOmACLcB/s320/m1rI9.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9iag99Llw-M/WEaLilMFRRI/AAAAAAAAFPM/73BBEPdmUroYGnCtAKbbw_v9jVKvXWOmACLcB/s1600/m1rI9.png)\n\n  \n\n\nBack a few years I took up shell scripting in college, did some of it and then forgot it. I still have those programs somewhere in my backup drive, with a few loops and a few commands like echoing date, your name, etc. I made another modification that the script asked for your name and then echo,`\"Hi <your name> ! Nice to meet you! \"` . Then I got bored, as studying the syntax without any actual purpose did not interest me. But that knowledge definitely helped me understanding how Linux commands work and how I can play around with them.\n\n  \n\n\nI claimed I know some of shell scripting, and so was handed a two days deadline to automate the whole thing. Looks like even the experts claim to know 'some' shell scripting. I learnt a lot while I was on it, that I am going to write here.\n\n  \n\n\n### The Variables\n\nOf course, declaration of a variable was never difficult. Where can I go wrong here?\n\n`path = \"/path/to/some/directory/that/I/will/use/a/lot/many/times\"`\n\non using the command `cat $path/some-fancy-name-of-dir/some-fancy-name-of-a-file`\n\nI get a \"no such file or directory\" error. After an hour of toil and reading shell scripting basics, I realized the problem was the spaces : before and after '`=`' . After writing lots of neat and formatted code, I was subconsciously doing it. No unnecessary spaces Amita, No.\n\n  \n\n\n### The Quotes\n\nSingle quotes for string. Double quotes for variables in string.\n\n  \n\n\n### The Curly Braces for Isolating a Variable\n\nIf I have a variable `$var` and I want to append '`_temp`' to `$var` and assign it to another variable `$var2`, I would write it as :\n\n`var2=${var}_temp` , instead of confusing the shell by writing `$var_temp`.\n\n  \n\n\n### Indirect Expansion using !\n\n! is used for indirect expansion, that is, introducing one level of expansion of variable. Let me illustrate:\n\n``  \n\n\n    var1=first\n    var2=second\n    i=1\n    readvar=var$i\n    echo $readvar  #prints var1\n    echo ${!readvar} #prints first, i.e. the value of $var1\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n### Replace command\n\nThe replace command comes handy whenever I want to replace string in-place in files. As simple as:\n\n`replace from to from to <input-file >output-file`\n\nIt is really convenient as I used it for replacement of multiple strings. But I had to be careful that I had to use different files for input and output.\n\n  \n\n\n### Sed\n\nYes, this is the time. Finally got my hands dirty with sed.\n\nSed is a stream editor, comes handy when you want to modify files, or do some complex manipulation in each line of each file. Just write the script, or use it directly, to one or more files. Sed does what the replace does, and much more than that. I dealt mainly with the substitution command, and delete command.\n\n-   My purpose : to replace one string with another string. As simple as:`sed 's/from/to/g' <input-file >output-file`\n-   Here, the 's' stands for substitution, and 'g' defines it global. If used without the 'g'. Sed will replace only the first occurrence of each line.\n-   Use double quotes instead of single if you want to use variables instead of the actual string.\n-   The/is a delimiter. If there is a / in the string itself, we can use any other delimiter, such as colon ( : )\n-   Similar to s, you can use 'd' to delete the line in which the string matched.\n-   One of my tasks was to remove anything that occurs after a string in each line. For this, we can simply use sed :`sed 's/word*/word'`\n\n  \n\n\nThe list seems too short for now. Possibly it is rather the experience that counts.

            "rawMarkdownBody": "\nApache Hive is a client side library that is used to provide an abstraction of the data in HDFS, in the form of tables. Hive jobs are internally converted to MR plan, submitted to Hadoop cluster for execution. Now let's move on to know what is the Hive metastore.  \n  \n\n\n### The Metastore\n\nThe Hive table definitions and mappings are stored in what is called the Hive Metastore. The metastore is nothing but two of its components :  \n\n\n-   A service to which the Hive Driver connects to and queries the database schema.\n-   A relational database to hold metadata, suppose MySQL.\n\nSo what if we have some hive tables, and we want to work on this metadata while, suppose, using Pig? We can either make a way out to query metadata using our own tool, or we can make use of the Hive metadata that is already stored.\n\n  \n\n\nHere comes the job of HCatalog.\n\n  \n\n\n### HCatalog\n\nAs discussed, HCatalog makes Hive metadata available to users of other Hadoop tools like Pig, MapReduce, Hive (yes! why not!). It provides connectors for MR and Pig so that users can read/write from/to hive metastore. HCatalog provides read and write interfaces for Pig and MapReduce and uses Hive’s command line interface for issuing data definition and metadata exploration commands. Once you have the HDFS data stored in Hive, then you do not need to rewrite the schema when using other tools. You can directly access metadata of tables using HCatalog.\n\n  \n\n\nHCatalog has some other functions as well:\n\n-   Users do not need to worry about the data format being used. Table abstraction presents users a relational view of data. HCatalog supports reading and writing files in any format for which a Hive SerDe (serializer-deserializer) can be written.\n-   It also presents a REST interface to allow external tools access to Hive DDL (Data Definition Language) operations, such as “create table” and “describe table”.\n-   Notification service : Notifies workflow tools, e.g. Oozie that some data has changed.\n\nToday we will discuss using HCatalog in Java.\n\n###   \nWhy not JDBC?\n\nNow that you know that hive metastore is stored in a relational database, why not make a simple JDBC connection? Why not directly query this meta table stored in MySQL using simple SQL queries? I too had the same doubt, but there can be a few reasons for not doing so.\n\n-   What if you do not get the credentials? We know that to connect using JDBC, we need to provide the username and password. But what if you are not given access to that? Have a look at [this](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22964302/is-there-a-way-to-access-hive-metastore-tables-from-hcatalog) StackOverflow question to understand what I am talking about. HCatalog gives you good info about metadata, without the need to directly access it.\n-   Just a connection to HCatClient does it all. One does not need to go into further details of the connection or provide any other configuration settings. HCatalog abstracts it all for us.\n\n### The Code\n\nNow let us see how we can code HCatalog to get Hive metadata.\n\nFirst of all, we need the required dependencies :\n\n  \n\n\n  \nApart from these, we may need other dependencies as well, so as to be able to run the complete application.  \nNow, let's start writing our main program. In this example, I have attempted to extract the column details of a table in hive.

These components run their own daemons.  \n  \n\n\n### HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System)\n\n  \nThe Hadoop Distributed File System is designed to provide fault tolerant and scalable storage deployed on commodity hardware. By commodity hardware, we mean that it is based on low-cost hardware. It provides high throughput access to large datasets. It has a master-slave architecture, comprising of master and slave nodes.  \n  \n\n\n#### Name Nodes\n\nThe name node is a daemon whose single instance runs for a single cluster, on the master node. Its responsibility is to manage the meta data of all the files that are distributed across the cluster. The name node acts as a single point of failure here.  \n  \n\n\n#### Data Nodes\n\nSeveral instances of data node run on the slave nodes. The data nodes store data in slots that are of size 64 MB by default. A single data block is replicated several times depending upon the replication factor. Data nodes send heart-beat (a signal) to name node to indicate it is running.  \n  \n\n\n### Map Reduce\n\nMap Reduce is a programming model, that does distributed computing on a Hadoop cluster. It consists of two daemons:  \n  \n\n\n#### Job tracker\n\nA single instance of job tracker runs on the same node as the name node.

We discussed as to how Normal Forms can be used to determine whether or not to decompose a database, and how to decompose it.  \n  \nWe need to be very careful while decomposing a database. Any improper decomposition may lead to errors in database design.  \n  \nTo check if a decomposition is proper, we need to satisfy the following properties:  \n  \n\n\n1.  It must be a lossless join\n2.  It must be dependency preserving\n\nLet's discuss these properties in detail.\n\n  \n\n\n### Lossless\n\nSuppose a relation R is decomposed into R1 and R2.\n\nA decomposition is said to be loss less if R1 ∩R2 is the candidate key of any decomposed relation.\n\nHence, for relation R(ABC) \\[ Primary Key A] the following relations are lossless:\n\n-   R1( A,B) and R2( A, C) \\[ R1 ∩ R2 = A, and A is the primary key of R1 & R2]\n-   R1( A, C ) and R2( C, A ) \\[ R1 ∩ R2 = C, and C is the primary key of R2]\n-   R1( A, B ) and R2 ( B,C ) \\[ R1 ∩ R2 = B, and B is the candidate key of R2]\n\nOn the other hand, the decomposition\n\nR1( A,C ) and R2( B,C ) is not lossless, as R1 ∩ R2 = C, which is not the primary key of any of the relations R1 or R2.\n\n  \n\n\nHence, a loss less decomposition ensures that the attributes involved in the natural join (R1 ∩ R2) are candidate key if at least one of the two relations.\n\nThis, in turn ensures that we can never get a situation where false tuples are generated. For any value on the join attributes there will be a unique tuple in one of the relations.\n\n  \n\n\n### Dependency Preserving\n\nDependency is said to be**preserved**if we can derive all the original dependencies from the FDs after decomposition.\n\nFormally stating, if closure of functional dependencies after decomposition is same as closure of Fds after decomposition, then dependencies are preserved.\n"

To store data effectively, we must ensure that the data is non-redundant. This reduces conflicts. But how to design such a database that the conflicts are reduced? The answer lies in Normalization.  \n  \n[](<>)  \nA database designed keeping in mind normalization techniques leads to a more robust design and avoid the problems that can crop up later. This design is viewed in terms of Functional Dependencies, that we studied in the previous post.  \nRemember that a relation containing only 2 attributes is always normalized.  \n  \nLet's start now.  \n  \n\n\n### First Normal Form\n\nThe first states a simple rule : If all attributes in a relation are atomic, then the relation is in First Normal Form.  \n\n\n#### What does it mean for an attribute to be atomic?\n\nAn atomic attribute means that the values of that attribute can not be further divided.  \n  \nSuppose a relation has an attribute called 'Name'. Now, a name can have sub-attributes like First Name, Middle Name, and Last Name. In this case, instead of having one attribute, we should divide it into separate attributes. Therefore, we should delete the attribute 'Name' and place 3 attributes : 'First Name', 'Middle Name' and 'Last Name'.  \n  \n  \n\n\n### Second Normal Form\n\nAny relation is said to be in Second Normal Form:\n\n-   if it is in First Normal Form, and\n-   all non-prime attributes are fully, functionally dependent on the candidate key.\n\nTo check if a relation is in Second Normal Form,\n\n-   find the Candidate Key. To know how to find candidate key in a relation, check my previous post :[Relational Database Design](http://shuklaamita.blogspot.in/2016/06/relational-database-functional-dependencies-canonical-cover-keys.html)\n-   Find **Prime attributes**. Prime Attributes are those attributes that comprise a candidate key. So, if a Relation(ABC) has AB as its primary key, then A and B are prime attributes.\n-   Find **Non-Prime attributes**. All those attributes that are not prime are non-prime attributes (that was simple :D) . Hence, as in the above example, C is a non-prime attribute.\n\nLet's elaborate on what is a fully functional dependency before moving further.\n\n#### Fully Functional Dependency\n\nFor an FD to be fully functional, any subset of the candidate key (i.e. the prime attributes) should not determine any non-prime attribute.If so happens, it is called as**Partial Dependency**.\n\n  \n\n\nConsider the following diagrams for a relation R(ABCD), here the arrows represent dependency.\n\n| [![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B98Be2W44Mc/V3ZPh8bumSI/AAAAAAAABOs/TlFmJii3KfAzo0tc3VQBA521ZHR1JtoJACLcB/s1600/Fully%252BFunctional%252BDependency.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B98Be2W44Mc/V3ZPh8bumSI/AAAAAAAABOs/TlFmJii3KfAzo0tc3VQBA521ZHR1JtoJACLcB/s1600/Fully%252BFunctional%252BDependency.png) |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Fully Functional Dependency                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\n  \n\n\n| [![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0C0A464XgsU/V3ZP-adQklI/AAAAAAAABOw/FTrTT_26-aQo6isUxeJ9ft12_DnZ2XSzACLcB/s1600/Partial%252BDependency.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0C0A464XgsU/V3ZP-adQklI/AAAAAAAABOw/FTrTT_26-aQo6isUxeJ9ft12_DnZ2XSzACLcB/s1600/Partial%252BDependency.png) |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Partial Dependency                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nYou might think, what if one non-prime attribute determines another non-prime attribute? Wait wait. We will get to that.\n\n  \n\n\nBut first, we must discuss what should be done if we find a relation that is not in 2 NF.\n\n#### Decomposing a relation into 2NF\n\nA relation can be decomposed into multiple relations in 2NF. The partial dependencies with the same attribute on the left are combined together to form a separate relation. Consider the following diagram:\n\n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0C0A464XgsU/V3ZP-adQklI/AAAAAAAABO4/F7NmOheyNVcuoBMjewiACIDMU2VaoC_4ACKgB/s1600/Partial%252BDependency.png)](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0C0A464XgsU/V3ZP-adQklI/AAAAAAAABO4/F7NmOheyNVcuoBMjewiACIDMU2VaoC_4ACKgB/s1600/Partial%252BDependency.png)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nHere,\n\nAB →C : full\n\nAB →D : full\n\nB →C : partial\n\n  \n\n\nTherefore R(AB, C, D ) can be decomposed into:\n\nR1(AB, C, D) \\[Primary Key: AB]\n\nR2(B, C) \\[Primary Key : B]\n\n  \n\n\n| [![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B98Be2W44Mc/V3ZPh8bumSI/AAAAAAAABO0/XkJIIb8ceRQovPz-IwS8K314RRjJ2JXAgCKgB/s1600/Fully%252BFunctional%252BDependency.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-B98Be2W44Mc/V3ZPh8bumSI/AAAAAAAABO0/XkJIIb8ceRQovPz-IwS8K314RRjJ2JXAgCKgB/s1600/Fully%252BFunctional%252BDependency.png) |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| R1 in 2 NF                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n\n  \n\n\n| [![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9WgR-Qd_Bjo/V3acYI8RLtI/AAAAAAAABQA/keQ8eI1g7PASQSzeX2tgb3LQj3HjVKFGwCLcB/s1600/R2%252BIn%252B2%252BNF.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-9WgR-Qd_Bjo/V3acYI8RLtI/AAAAAAAABQA/keQ8eI1g7PASQSzeX2tgb3LQj3HjVKFGwCLcB/s1600/R2%252BIn%252B2%252BNF.png) |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| R2 in 2NF                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n\n  \n\n\nNote that when the candidate key contains a single attribute, the need for looking up for full or partial dependencies is eliminated, as no subset of the candidate key is possible.\n\nHence, such a relation is automatically in 2NF. You can **save** yourself from all the above analysis :P\n\n  \n\n\n### Third Normal Form\n\nA relation is in 3NF if it is in 2NF and all non-prime attributes are non-transitively dependent on candidate key.\n\nConsider the following diagram for a relation R(ABCD) with FDs:\n\nAB→C\n\nAB→D\n\nC →D\n\n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qI9BVFFvhew/V3Z6DSi7HAI/AAAAAAAABPM/kb4YvKwHaHcQC_q1NfZ_ZTsBQrPnPi-EACLcB/s1600/Not%252BIn%252B3NF.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qI9BVFFvhew/V3Z6DSi7HAI/AAAAAAAABPM/kb4YvKwHaHcQC_q1NfZ_ZTsBQrPnPi-EACLcB/s1600/Not%252BIn%252B3NF.png)\n\n  \n\n\nHere C is said to be transitively dependent on D. You can take it as, D has two owners: C, and AB. This can cause conflict in the schemas, at the time of insertion, deletion or updation.\n\n  \n\n\nThe wait ends here. The above diagram is very well in 2nd Normal Form but violates the rule of the Third Normal Form.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Decomposition of a relation into 3NF\n\nThe above relation R can be decomposed into two relations:\n\nR1(ABC) \\[Primary Key : AB]\n\nR2(CD) \\[Primary Key : C]\n\n  \n\n\n| [![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KvqlY8he8iA/V3Z60tnXBFI/AAAAAAAABPU/oWcSwgouNdwYob6edEEgVGwU5LpElQpIACLcB/s1600/R1%252BIn%252B3NF.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KvqlY8he8iA/V3Z60tnXBFI/AAAAAAAABPU/oWcSwgouNdwYob6edEEgVGwU5LpElQpIACLcB/s1600/R1%252BIn%252B3NF.png) |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| R1 in 3 NF                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n\n| [![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tkrREusspjI/V3Z7p5Umo5I/AAAAAAAABPg/8fIy1QK1SkciNk45AVpFCpKftFgQ5ZoKQCLcB/s1600/R2%252BIn%252B3NF.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-tkrREusspjI/V3Z7p5Umo5I/AAAAAAAABPg/8fIy1QK1SkciNk45AVpFCpKftFgQ5ZoKQCLcB/s1600/R2%252BIn%252B3NF.png) |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| R2 in 3 NF                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nSteps to decompose a relation into 3NF :\n\n-   Find Canonical Cover\n-   Find Candidate Key\n-   Consider all the FDs a new relation\n-   Combine those relations where the primary key is same.\n-   If none of the decomposed relations contain candidate key, add a new relation containing candidate key.\n\n### Boyce-Codd Normal Form\n\nA relation is said to be in BCNF if all determinants are candidate keys.\n\n-   Find Non-Redundant Cover.\n-   Determine the candidate key.\n-   Compare with determinants.\n\nBelow is an example depicting a relation which is in 3 NF but not in BCNF:\n\n  \n\n\n| [![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QbabxlUaZlc/V3aduDnAolI/AAAAAAAABQM/DIZz7GxyrIQQKaBZm0S_PXgHZxjzeXClgCLcB/s1600/Not%252BIn%252B3NF.png)](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QbabxlUaZlc/V3aduDnAolI/AAAAAAAABQM/DIZz7GxyrIQQKaBZm0S_PXgHZxjzeXClgCLcB/s1600/Not%252BIn%252B3NF.png) |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| In 3 NF but NOT in BCNF                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n\n  \n\n\nThe above are prominent Normal Forms that exist, and implied upon during database modeling.\n\nHowever, normalizing 'too' much a database can completely dissolve the purpose of a database. It can give rise to many small relations related to each other in a complex way.\n\nTherefore, the designers need to maintain a trade-off between normalization and performance. Some designers choose the other way: they deliberately store redundant data to improve search performance.\n\n  \n\n\n_Want to suggest edits?

              "content": "\nIn my previous [post](http://shuklaamita.blogspot.in/2016/06/relational-database-functional-dependencies-canonical-cover-keys.html), we discussed Relational Database Design. To store data effectively, we must ensure that the data is non-redundant. This reduces conflicts. But how to design such a database that the conflicts are reduced? The answer lies in Normalization.  \n  \n[](<>)  \nA database designed keeping in mind normalization techniques leads to a more robust design and avoid the problems that can crop up later. This design is viewed in terms of Functional Dependencies, that we studied in the previous post.  \nRemember that a relation containing only 2 attributes is always normalized.  \n  \nLet's start now.  \n  \n\n\n### First Normal Form\n\nThe first states a simple rule : If all attributes in a relation are atomic, then the relation is in First Normal Form.  \n\n\n#### What does it mean for an attribute to be atomic?\n\nAn atomic attribute means that the values of that attribute can not be further divided.  \n  \nSuppose a relation has an attribute called 'Name'. Now, a name can have sub-attributes like First Name, Middle Name, and Last Name. In this case, instead of having one attribute, we should divide it into separate attributes. Therefore, we should delete the attribute 'Name' and place 3 attributes : 'First Name', 'Middle Name' and 'Last Name'.  \n  \n  \n\n\n### Second Normal Form\n\nAny relation is said to be in Second Normal Form:\n\n-   if it is in First Normal Form, and\n-   all non-prime attributes are fully, functionally dependent on the candidate key.\n\nTo check if a relation is in Second Normal Form,\n\n-   find the Candidate Key. To know how to find candidate key in a relation, check my previous post :[Relational Database Design](http://shuklaamita.blogspot.in/2016/06/relational-database-functional-dependencies-canonical-cover-keys.html)\n-   Find **Prime attributes**. Prime Attributes are those attributes that comprise a candidate key. So, if a Relation(ABC) has AB as its primary key, then A and B are prime attributes.\n-   Find **Non-Prime attributes**. All those attributes that are not prime are non-prime attributes (that was simple :D) . Hence, as in the above example, C is a non-prime attribute.\n\nLet's elaborate on what is a fully functional dependency before moving further.\n\n#### Fully Functional Dependency\n\nFor an FD to be fully functional, any subset of the candidate key (i.e. the prime attributes) should not determine any non-prime attribute.If so happens, it is called as**Partial Dependency**.\n\n  \n\n\nConsider the following diagrams for a relation R(ABCD), here the arrows represent dependency.\n\n| [![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B98Be2W44Mc/V3ZPh8bumSI/AAAAAAAABOs/TlFmJii3KfAzo0tc3VQBA521ZHR1JtoJACLcB/s1600/Fully%252BFunctional%252BDependency.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-B98Be2W44Mc/V3ZPh8bumSI/AAAAAAAABOs/TlFmJii3KfAzo0tc3VQBA521ZHR1JtoJACLcB/s1600/Fully%252BFunctional%252BDependency.png) |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Fully Functional Dependency                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n\n  \n\n\n| [![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0C0A464XgsU/V3ZP-adQklI/AAAAAAAABOw/FTrTT_26-aQo6isUxeJ9ft12_DnZ2XSzACLcB/s1600/Partial%252BDependency.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0C0A464XgsU/V3ZP-adQklI/AAAAAAAABOw/FTrTT_26-aQo6isUxeJ9ft12_DnZ2XSzACLcB/s1600/Partial%252BDependency.png) |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Partial Dependency                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nYou might think, what if one non-prime attribute determines another non-prime attribute?

For an enterprise, database management is crucial, for purposes such as sales, accounting, manufacturing, banking etc. Almost every institution in today's world needs to maintain a database.  \n  \n\n\n### Relational Database\n\nRelational Databases became dominant for commercial applications. Other types of database models that exist are Network, Object, Hierarchical systems. In a relational database, the data is organized in the form of tables (or relations ). These tables are organized into rows and columns. This model is named so because of its underlying theme, it stores **inter-related** data.\n\n  \n\n\n### Primary Goals of a Relational Database\n\n-   Reduce Redundancy\n-   Minimize Access Times for information retrieval\n\n  \n\n\nLet us now discuss the formal approach to relational database design.\n\n  \n\n\nWhile E-R model is the graphical representation of entities and their relationships, relational database design requires representing all data in tables, by the use of some principles, known as **Normal Forms.**We will dig in them some other time. Let's get into some concepts about relational databases.\n\n**  \n**\n\nDatabase design aims to reduce (but not eliminate) Redundancy and perform INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE operations without confronting inconsistency.\n\n  \n\n\n### Functional Dependency\n\nA relational database is expressed in terms of relations. There are several attributes that **depend** on each other, and in many different ways. For large and complex databases, it gets difficult to analyze which dependencies are logical and direct, and which ones are trivial and derived. We can ignore the later ones, because, if implied, they can cause redundancy and inconsistency in a database.  \n  \nTo formally represent these 'dependencies', we have Functional Dependencies. It can be stated as:  \n\n\n#### A→ B\n\nmeans, A functionally determines B, i.e. B ⊆ A.\n\n  \n\n\n### Closure of Attribute Sets\n\nThe full set of values that can be determined from a set of known values for a given relationship using its functional dependencies is called Closure.\n\n  \n\n\nFor example, R(ABC)\n\nIt means a relation R containing A,B,C columns , given the following dependencies exist :\n\nF: A→ B\n\nB→ C\n\n  \n\n\nthen, the closure F+ = A→ B  \nB→ C  \nA→ C  \n  \n  \n\n\n### Armstrong's Axioms\n\nClosure is computed using Armstrong's Axioms:  \n\n\n**1.****Reflexive**\n\nA → B ⇒ B ⊆ A\n\n**2. Augmentation**\n\nA→ B ⇒CA → CB\n\n**3. Transitivity**\n\nA→B, B→ C⇒A→ C\n\n**4. Union**\n\nA→ B, A →C ⇒ A →BC\n\n**5. Decomposition**\n\nA→ BC ⇒ A →B, A → C\n\n**6. Pseudo-transitivity**\n\nA→B, BC → D ⇒ AC → D\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nFor example, let a set F be:\n\n**A →B  \nA →C  \nBC →D**\n\nThen the closure F+ will be  \n(i) A →B  \n(ii) A →C  \n(iii) BC →D  \n\\[ The given FDs are of course a part of closure ]  \n(iv) A → BC \\[ Union ]  \n(v) A →D \\[ Transitivity Rule on (iv) and (v) ]  \n(vi) A → BCD \\[ Union on (iv) and (v) ]  \n(vii) AC →D \\[ Augmentation and then Transitivity ]  \n  \n\n\n### Non- Redundant Cover\n\n-   For a given set of FD's, choose any desired FD.\n-   Find the closure of the attribute on the left, not considering the chosen FD.\n-   If the closure of the FD contains the attribute on the right of the chosen FD, we say that the FD is redundant.\n-   Hence, remove that FD and move on to next one.\n\nFor example, given set of FDs :\n\n**A →BC**\n\n**CD →E**\n\n**E →C**\n\n**D →AEH**\n\n**ABH → BD**\n\n**DH →BC**\n\n**  \n**\n\nLets find out the redundant FDs:\n\nA+ = A \\[ Remember, we are not considering the FD whose closure we are finding ]\n\nCD+ = CDAEHB \\[ As this FD contains E int its closure, we mark it as **redundant**]\n\nE+ = E\n\nD+ = D\n\nABH+ = ABHC\n\nDH+ = DHAEBC \\[ As this FD contains BC in its closure, we mark it as **redundant**]\n\n  \nThe problem is that they depend on the order in which you start evaluating. Solution to non redundant cover may not be unique if there are more than 1 candidate key.  \n  \n\n\n### Canonical Cover\n\nA Canonical cover for a relation is a reduced set of Functional Dependencies whose closure will be the same as the actual FDs. A canonical cover is a simplification of the original dependencies and hence it is easier to test for any dependency violations in a relation.  \n  \n Following are the steps to compute canonical cover:  \n  \n\n\n-   Make the attributes simple. That is, apply Decomposition Rule to all dependencies such that there is only a single attribute on the right of all FDs.\n-   Now, remove the redundant FDs by finding closure, using the same procedure as above for redundant cover.\n-   Now make a check again. Make sure that the left side of each dependency does not have any **extraneous** attributes. An attribute of a functional dependency is said to be extraneous if we can remove it without affecting the closure of the set of FDs. If there exist any such attributes, then remove them.\n\n  \nLets take the above example,  \n  \n\n\n**A →BC**\n\n**E →C**\n\n**D →AEH**\n\n**ABH → BD**\n\nAs you can see, I have already removed the redundant dependencies.  \n**  \n** Step 1: Make the FDs 'simple'.  \nA →B  \nA →C  \nE →C  \nD →A  \nD →E  \nD →H  \nABH → B  \nABH →D  \n  \n\n\n  \nStep 2: Remove redundant dependencies.  \nA+ = AC  \nA+ = AB  \nE+ = E  \nD+ = DHEC  \nD+ = DABHC  \nD+ = DAEBC  \n  \nWe can not find any redundancy here.  \n  \nStep 3:  \nLet us check for any redundant attributes on the left side.  \n  \nSince A → B \\[ To understand it better you can interpret it as B⊆ A]  \nTherefore the FD:ABH →D can be written as AH →D.  \n  \nHence, the canonical cover is:  \nA →B  \nA →C  \nE →C  \nD →A  \nD →E  \nD →H  \nAH →D  \n  \n\n\n### Keys, Keys Everywhere\n\nLets get in terms with the keys and know about their role in a schema:\n\n  \n\n\n#### Candidate Key\n\nA candidate key is a key, or a column ( or a set of columns) that can be used to uniquely identify a row in a table. Let an attribute be A. If A+ contains all the attributes of the relation to which it belongs, then we can take it as a super set, and A can be taken as a candidate key.\n\nA candidate key is called so because they are candidates for primary key.\n\n  \n\n\nFor example, given the FDs:\n\nA →D\n\nA → B\n\nB →C\n\nD →A\n\n  \n\n\nA+ = ABCD\n\nD+ = ABCD\n\n  \n\n\nHence, A and D are candidate keys.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Primary Key\n\nThe primary key is the 'chosen one'. Out if all the candidate keys, we choose one key that is used to determine uniquely the rows of a table. Remember that, a primary key:\n\n-   is unique.\n-   does not contain null values.\n\nAll the candidate keys other than the primary key (the not chosen ones) are termed as **Alternate Keys.**\n\nIn the above example, we can choose A as the primary key, then D becomes the alternate key.\n\n**  \n**\n\n#### Super Key\n\nIf the closure of a key contains all the attributes of a relation, but the one that can be minimized further, is called super key.\n\n  \n\n\nLet us take a key DC. Since D is already a candidate key, DC is super key. Here, C is redundant.\n\n  \n\n\n### How to Find Candidate Key\n\nAs you can understand now, the key lies in finding the candidate key. Following are the ways to find the Candidate Key:\n\n-   Choose any attribute and take its closure. This time, remember to include the attributes on the right side of the chosen FD.\n-   If the closure contains all the attributes that exist in the given relation, then it is a candidate key.\n-   If the closure of a single key is not able to produce all the attributes, take the union of one more attribute and try again.\n-   In the worst case, all the attributes of the relation will comprise of the candidate key.\n\n  \n\n",

One way we can think of is that we can poll the directory (file system) from time to time to record any changes.  \n  \nBut the API that comes to our rescue is Watch Service API, in java.nio.file package.  \n  \n\n\n### How does Watch Service API work?\n\nWhen a watch service is initiated, a separate thread is launched that keeps track of the changes in the specified directory.\n\nFrom the main(), I call a method called runWatch(). This initiates the whole process.\n\n  \n\n\nAs you can see I call a method of the WatchDir class.  \nThe WatchDir class contains the functionalities needed for watching over the directory.  \nIn the constructor, we can initiate the 'watcher'. The watcher is nothing but an instance of WatchService API, that will do the job for us.  \n  \n  \n\n\n  \nThe register() assigns the watcher. Other events can also be specified, such as  \n  \n\n\n-   ENTRY_CREATE\n-   ENTRY_DELETE\n-   OVERFLOW\n\nNext is the processEvents(). This method creates an infinite loop which polls for events and as and when they happen, it reports them.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThe processing events are described aptly in the Oracle WatchService API tutorial :\n\n  \n\n\nThe order of events in an event processing loop follow:\n\n> 1.  Get a watch key. Three methods are provided:\n>\n>     -   [`poll`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/WatchService.html#poll--) – Returns a queued key, if available. Returns immediately with a `null` value, if unavailable.\n>     -   [`poll(long, TimeUnit)`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/WatchService.html#poll-long-java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit-) – Returns a queued key, if one is available. If a queued key is not immediately available, the program waits until the specified time. The`TimeUnit` argument determines whether the specified time is nanoseconds, milliseconds, or some other unit of time.\n>     -   [`take`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/WatchService.html#take--) – Returns a queued key. If no queued key is available, this method waits.\n>\n> 2.  Process the pending events for the key. You fetch the `List` of [`WatchEvents`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/WatchEvent.html)from the [`pollEvents`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/WatchKey.html#pollEvents--) method.\n>\n> 3.  Retrieve the type of event by using the [`kind`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/WatchEvent.html#kind--) method. No matter what events the key has registered for, it is possible to receive an `OVERFLOW` event. You can choose to handle the overflow or ignore it, but you should test for it.\n>\n> 4.  Retrieve the file name associated with the event. The file name is stored as the context of the event, so the [`context`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/WatchEvent.html#context--) method is used to retrieve it.\n>\n> 5.  After the events for the key have been processed, you need to put the key back into a `ready` state by invoking [`reset`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/WatchEvent.html#reset--). If this method returns `false`, the key is no longer valid and the loop can exit. This step is very **important**. If you fail to invoke `reset`, this key will not receive any further events.\n\n  \nWhen an event occurs, we can either print the result using System.out.println , or call another function that takes these values further and does whatever else we may want.  \nFor example, in this project, I have transferred the file name and the event type, which passes these values to another object to further work on it.  \n  \nSo, we are done! You might get overwhelmed thinking about the complexity of the task, but it's quite simple as we dig into it.  \n  \nHere is the complete code of WatchDir class that handles Watch Service API.  \n  \n  \n\n\nYou can get the code and project [here](https://github.com/amita-shukla/file-scanner/blob/master/src/WatchDir.java) at GitHub.  \n  \n  \n_Want to suggest edits?

What does wonders is:\n\n### CSS !!\n\n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DNLmmOlaZP8/V1Rg8-JI4kI/AAAAAAAABMY/I843zqOZC5MHJ9IVKzyzAoUAws2oeTMTQCLcB/s1600/blog_css.png)](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-DNLmmOlaZP8/V1Rg8-JI4kI/AAAAAAAABMY/I843zqOZC5MHJ9IVKzyzAoUAws2oeTMTQCLcB/s1600/blog_css.png)\n\n  \nFirst I needed to find out the class that surrounds this image.  \n  \nAfter search (using ctrl + f ) in the 'template' section, we can find classes like `post-image`, `img` .  \nThese classes are most likely to affect the image in the blog.  \n  \nI found out the code as :  \n  \n\n\n    .post-image img{\n        max-width:100%;\n        height:auto;\n    }\n\nI changed the attributes here, as:  \n  \n\n\n    .post-image img{\n        max-width:50%;\n        height:auto;\n     }\n\n  \n\n\nThis is because I realized that this is the setting for images in individual posts, where the images were displayed normally.  \nAnd voila! it worked.  \nBut this caused another problem, all the images were shifted to the left!  \n  \nTo fix this, I decided to make it up by coding CSS to bring images to the center area of the surrounding `div`. This is done by :  \n  \n\n\n    .post-image img{\n        display:block;\n        margin-left:auto;\n        margin-right:auto;\n        max-width:50%;\n        height:auto;\n    }\n\nLets review what these properties do.  \n  \n\n\n#### display\n\nThe display property controls how an element is displayed in accordance with the parent element. The display property can be of two types: block and inline.\n\n  \n\n\nBlock means that the element will acquire a complete block, that is, will take up the whole area in which it is extended, from left to right. e.g. div\n\nInline means, that the element will be lined up with the surrounding text. e.g. span.\n\n  \n\n\nHere the img is block that means it takes up the whole space.\n\n  \n\n\n#### margin\n\nThe margin specifies the space around the elements, outside the border. It can be margin-top, margin-bottom, margin-left, margin-right.\n\nTo bring the image to the center, I defined the left and right margin to auto. The auto property lets the margin to be calculated by the browser. Using this, we align the image element in the center horizontally.\n\n  \n\n\nAs I could not find this fix anywhere else, I added it on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/37643409/3858467).\n"

This implies that this technique was developed to minimize the time, or space, or both of a problem, which, had it been solved in usual way could consume a lot of time/space.  \n  \n  \n\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ipk2UXKZCzA/V1QvPmNEJoI/AAAAAAAABLo/QMoA3Rcjw7Et1sQvnF2yRLPhmkJtVqX0QCLcB/s320/Blog_DP_Quote.png)](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Ipk2UXKZCzA/V1QvPmNEJoI/AAAAAAAABLo/QMoA3Rcjw7Et1sQvnF2yRLPhmkJtVqX0QCLcB/s1600/Blog_DP_Quote.png)\n\n  \n  \n  \nThe technique involves two basic approaches:  \n  \n\n\n-   Top Down method with Memoization\n-   Bottom Up method\n\n#### Top Down method with memoization\n\n1.  Write down the recursive solution to the problem.\n2.  This solution is generally inefficient.\n3.  Hence, to optimize it, save the result of each function call in a table.\n4.  This table can be an array (1-D or 2-D), map etc\n5.  Also, on each function call, first check if a solution is already saved in the table.\n6.  If so, then return the result.\n7.  If not, then continue the computation.

Use this solution to solve the suproblems in increasing order of size.\n\n  \n\n\n#### How is Bottom up method different from Divide And Conquer Approach?\n\nYes, both involve solving of subproblems. But there are differences:\n\n1.  The key in Dynamic programming is remembering. It saves the result of the subproblems it solves. Divide and Conquer Approach involves recursion.\n2.  The Divide and Conquer Approach does not need to save the result as each subproblem is different. However, in bottom up method, solution to a subproblem may be used in solution to any other problem. Hence, saving the result matters.\n\n### Elements of Dynamic Programming\n\nProblems that can be solved using Dynamic Programming tend to have the following properties:\n\n#### Optimal Substructure\n\nThis means that the optimal solution to a problem contains within it the optimal solution to its subproblems.

But I almost forgot how confused I got at the the starting! I could understand all the theory and command, but how to start? This was a big question back then.  \n  \nIn this article, I would like to discuss about as to how you can set up your git repository and get going.  \nIts simple, you can merge any of your coding activities with git, enjoy a better control over your code and save yourself if anything gets messed up!  \n  \nI will discuss the theory , commands and other aspects in probably some other article. For this one, I am focusing on the basic setup (as the heading says).  \n  \n\n\n### Prerequisites\n\n#### Git installed in your system\n\n<https://git-scm.com/downloads>\n\n  \n\n\nI use git in both my operating systems, Ubuntu and Windows. And the command line is my favourite tool.  \nIn debian systems, the command is as simple as:\n\n  \n\n\n`sudo apt-get install git`  \n  \nFor windows, I have downloaded the Git Bash desktop app ( woohoo! ). Sorry Git GUI I will touch you some other time!\n\n  \n\n\n#### GitHub Account\n\nWe need a remote repository too. I have worked on other ones like BitBucket, but GitHub is good to go with.\n\n  \n\n\n### Let's Start\n\n#### Create Online Repository\n\nLog in your GitHub account and click the '**+**' sign. This is the first thing that GitHub asks you to do.\n\n  \n\n\nCreate a repository. Let's say you name it 'hello-world'.\n\n  \n\n\nObserve the pattern of naming. Lowercase letters and spaces marked by hyphens.\n\nYou can give it the description you want, as it says, it is optional.\n\n  \n\n\nLet all other things remain as it is. If you wish, though, you can add a README.md file here as well, but I prefer creating it afterwards (just a preference).\n\n  \n\n\nYou are done here until now.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Configure Account\n\nLets move to you local machine. The local machine is the system on which you will be working, on which you save your code and have installed git.\n\n  \n\n\nFirst of all, Configure Your Account on your computer. Enter the commands:  \n  \n`git config --global user.name \"your-user-name\"`\n\n`git config --global user.email \"your-email\"`\n\n  \n\n\nThis is how you have informed the git as to what your user name is and by what name should it recognize you.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Create Local Repository\n\nNow its the time to set up your local workspace, i.e. the directory where you will be working.\n\nCreate a local directory at your preferred location with the same name as your online repository name (again, a preference, nothing else).\n\n  \n\n\n`mkdir hello-world`\n\n  \n\n\nMove to this newly created directory\n\n  \n\n\n`cd hello-world`\n\n  \n\n\nNow your are in the directory. I have been calling it a directory and not arepository because it is not yet. Let's initialize it as a git repo.\n\n  \n\n\n`git init`\n\n  \n\n\nYou will observe a hidden directory named '.git' here. This indicates you have initialized it.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Work now!\n\nNow you can work on this repository the way you like and code as many files you want. When you create a file, just add it:\n\n  \n\n\n`git add \"file name\"`\n\n  \n\n\nor your can add all files in a go\n\n  \n\n\n`git add .`\n\n  \n\n\nThis let's the git to monitor changes. You call this action as 'Staging'\n\n  \n\n\nNow that your files are staged, you can work on it and want to permanently store the changes. Do it by using the git commit command:\n\n  \n\n\n`git commit -m 'commit message'`\n\n  \n\n\nThe commit message tells about the reason of commit .\n\n  \n\n\nDo not worry if you have done something wrong, you can always revert back to any previous commit anytime.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Connect To remote Repository\n\nLet the git know that to which remote repository you want it to point to:\n\n  \n\n\n`git remote add origin \"link to GitHub repository\"`\n\n  \n\n\nThis link is mentioned at the side of your repository page. Make sure you choose http version. We will try the ssl way some other day!\n\n  \n\n\n#### Push Changes To GitHub\n\nYou can push the changes to your remote repository from time to time.\n\n  \n\n\n`git push origin master`\n\n  \n\n\nThe command asks you your user name and password. Don't worry if the password is not shown typed. It is an excellent feature of Linux systems.\n\n  \n\n\nIf an error is displayed like:\n\n  \n\n\n`ssl certificate problem:self signed certificate in certificate chain`\n\n  \n\n\nTry the command:\n\n  \n\n\n`git config --global http.sslVerify false`\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nExplore More\n\nA lot more can be done with git. We can fork, branch, merge and what not!\n\n  \n\n\nI have a repository that is a cheat sheet for git at the following link:\n\n<https://github.com/amita-shukla/git-guide>\n\n  \n\n",

              "content": "\nAs I dig deeper and deeper into the MATLAB world, I learn new concepts everyday. I must say, MATLAB is very flexible. After working on languages like JAVA and C for long, working on MATLAB has given me a new sense of freedom : I have got rid of the braces ! I am so habitual of defining scope in the form of curly braces {} , that I tend to use them in MATLAB without realizing it to the point of compilation error.  \n  \nBut hey! Who says the braces have gone? The are here to stay. This time they have come in a rather more dramatic way. In the form of The Notation of Cell Arrays.  \n  \n\n\nUntil now, I was happily working with the following form of indexing:\n\n  \n\n\nIf A = \\[1 2; 3 4; 5 6],\n\nthen A(2,4) = 4.\n\n  \n\n\nJust the normal way of indexing.\n\nBut reading more into machine learning projects, I encountered this notation:\n\n  \n\n\nA{1,2} ...\n\n  \n\n\nNow what was this? Soon I found out it is a data type in MATLAB known as Cell Arrays.\n\n  \n\n\n### What are Cell Arrays?\n\nA Cell Array is made up of cells (of course). You can say these are containers, which can contain any type of data. Yes, any type, a character, a piece of text, a small matrix, any other big matrix and so on.  \n  \n  \n\n\n### Referencing a Cell Array\n\nNow here came the mind bender. I came across different kinds of notations, such as\n\n  \n\n\nA{1,2} = {1,2,3}; and\n\nA(1,2) = {1,2,3};\n\n  \n\n\nI assumed it is indexing in the same way in both cases. But there is a huge difference.\n\n  \n\n\nIf you enclose the indices in smooth parenthesis, i.e. '()' you mean to say that the value being assigned is a set of cells. Whereas, if you enclose them in curly braces, i.e.,'{}' you are actually referring to the content in individual cells.\n\n  \n\n\nAn example would make it clear.\n\nSuppose, I have\n\nThe two notations act in the same way if a single cell has to be updated:  \n\n\nBut as said above, smooth brackets can be used to refer to a set of cells and hence we can change the values of set of cells in a single sentence:\n\nAll these things look simple, but it took me a lot of time to debug these errors in my code. So beware!  \n  \nFor greater insight into it, you can look into the official [MATLAB page](http://in.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/access-data-in-a-cell-array.html).  \n  \nOn a side note, I used the [Online Octave Tool](http://octave-online.net/) to test the above code, as MATLAB is proprietary, Octave is suitable for most of the purposes.\n"

But as we go on more and more, we get to face an issue:  \n\"To what parts of the program is this variable accessible?\"  \n  \nEven if we get the answer to the above question, we may not be satisfied.  \nWhat if I want this variable to be accessible to only a few functions of the file?  \nWhat if I want this variable to be accessible outside this file as well?  \nWhat if I want this variable to never change?  \nWhat if I want this variable to be accessed faster?  \n  \nWhen we start write a program, we want to govern the way it works, instead of being governed by it! Understanding the scope rules helps us to handle the behaviour of variable easily.  \n  \n\n\n### What is a Scope?\n\nA scope of a name is the part of the program within which the name can be used.  \n  \nSo, if you use a variable 'a' as follows:  \n  \n  \nthen you can access the variable in the scope of the `if` section and no where else.  \n  \n\n\n### Local Variables : Automatic\n\nThe variables described as above are called automatic variables, aka local variables.  \nFor an automatic variable declared at the beginning of the function, the scope is the function in which it is declared. It is recreated every time the function is called. Local variables of the same name in different functions are unrelated.  \n  \nThe parameters of a function are also regarded as local variables to that function.  \nAutomatic variables are the simplest ones we deal with. We can declare them as  \n  \n`auto int a;`  \n  \nor simply,  \n  \n`int a;`  \n  \n\n\n#### \n\n#### Register Variables\n\nSome variables can be declared as register. This declaration 'advises' the compiler to place the variable in machine register, for faster access (may be due to very frequent use). However, the compiler can ignore this advice as well. If that is the case, the register variables are treated similar to automatic variables.\n\n  \n\n\nRegister variables come with some restrictions:\n\n-   A limited number of variables can be placed in registers,\n-   A register declaration can be applied to automatic variables and formal parameters to a function,\n-   It is not possible to know the address of a register, hence & operator cannot be applied.\n\nThe above restrictions may vary from machine to machine.  \n  \n\n\nWhat if we want a variable to be accessed outside a function?\n\n### Global Variables: External\n\nIf we declare a function at the beginning of the file, it is accessible all throughout the file. If we place it somewhere in between the definitions of two functions, it is accessible to all functions following the declaration.  \nAs beautifully illustrated in K&R : if we want some variables to be common to the `push()` and `pop()` functions, but not visible to other functions such as `main()`, then we can declare them after the `main()` function and before the `push()` and `pop()` functions.\n\n  \n  \n\n\nThe variables `top` and `val` are called external variables.  \nBut what if we want to use a variable before it is defined?\n\nor,what if it is defined in a different source file other than in which it is being used?\n\nIn such case, we need to declare the variable extern:  \n  \n  \nHere, the variables `sp`, `val` are defined in file 2, so to use them in file 1, we need to declare these variables as `extern` to be accessed by `push()` and `pop()` functions.  \n  \n\n\n### Static Variables\n\nThe static keyword is used to modify scope in several ways  \n\n\n#### External static\n\nThere are a few variables or function that we may want to use privately in that file. The static keyword, applied to an external variables, limits the scope of that object to the rest of the source file being complied. Similarly, if a function is declared as static, then the name is only visible to the file in which it is declared, instead of being visible to the entire program (as functions are global).  \n  \n\n\n#### Internal static\n\nIf a variable is declared as static inside a function, they are local to the function (like the automatic variables), but its value persists through the entire life of the program. This means that internal static variables provide private, permanent storage within a single function.  \n  \n  \nThe external and static variables are restricted to be assigned only constant and initialized only once, whereas automatic and register variables may be constant, or a part of expression, or can be assigned to the result of a function call.  \n  \n\n",

Some information needs to be present throughout some or all the pages of a website. For example, the user information. You usually see a message similar \"Welcome! Your name\" on the top of every page of the website in which you are logged in.\n\n  \n\n\n### Why was Session needed in Mail Aggregator?\n\nThe Mail Aggregator also uses session to maintain user information across the application. The client-server communication in this project occurs through web services, which do not maintain sessions , unlike those on which I previously worked, .NET, PHP, J2EE...\n\n  \n\n\nWriting my own implementation offered simplicity and flexibility. Personally, learning to build my session mechanism gave me an insight on how a session works which are otherwise beautifully packaged in popular web frameworks.\n\n  \n\n\n### An Outline\n\n1.  When a user logs in, verify if the credentials are correct.\n2.  If verified, create a token, such that it is unique for every user.\n3.  Save this token in the database with primary key as the token, along with user_id. We can have other details like timestamp (login time).\n4.  Send this token back to the client side where it can be saved as cookie.\n5.  Whenever any other web service is invoked, this token is sent back to server with other request data.\n6.  The token is received on the server side and its presence is checked in the database.\n7.  If an entry does not exist in the database, make the session invalid and send an error message to the client.\n8.  If an entry exists, extract the corresponding user_id, and carry forward the request.\n9.  On logging out, delete the token on the client side and the database entry on the server side.\n\nLets dive into the details.  \n  \n\n\n#### 1. User Log In\n\nThe details of the user are taken from the login form and packed as [JSON](http://www.json.org/) object and communicated to the server side by `LoginWebService`. The `LoginWebSerice` the calls the `LoginController`.  \nDig more: [LoginWebService.java](http://mail-aggregator/src/webservices/LoginWebService.java), [LoginController.java](http://mail-aggregator/src/controller/LoginController.java)  \n  \n\n\n#### 2. Create a unique token for every user\n\nFor creating a unique token, I assume that no two users attempt to login at the same time instant. This assumption holds true until the interface receives a lot of hits.\n\nThe token is chosen as:  \n  \n\n\nThe code above returns a 9 digit number.  \n  \n\n\n#### 3. Save the token in database\n\nWe can write a function that inserts this token in the database, such as given below. Let the table name be `token`.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n#### 4. Send token back to client side\n\nFor this project, I need to send a lot of information back for every request. But, as we know, we can only return a single object in java. Hence I wrap all the information in an object `serverResponse`.\n\nThe `serverResponse` object contains two fields, an object of `Object` type and an object of `Status` type.\n\n  \n\n\nThe `status` object contains information if the request made was successful or not.\n\n  \n\n\nAn object of Object type allows me to send any information irrespective of its type.\n\n  \n\n\nFor example, here I send the token (int type), whereas I send an arrayList of emails in another request.\n\nSo here, I set the object as token:\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nThis token is wrapped as JSON object and extracted on the client side using AJAX. The access token is saved in the user's browser:  \n  \n\n\n  \nDig in more: [Object type in java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html), [Status.java](https://github.com/amita-shukla/mail-aggregator/blob/master/src/Utils/Status.java), [ServerResponse.java](https://github.com/amita-shukla/mail-aggregator/blob/master/src/Utils/ServerResponse.java)\n\n  \n\n\n#### 5. Send token with other request data on each subsequent request\n\nThe token is attached with the data for each request that is made after the login as follows:\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nFor example, you can check function `invokeAddAccount()` in this [file](https://github.com/amita-shukla/mail-aggregator/blob/master/WebContent/UI/js/login.js).\n\n  \n\n\n#### 6. Verify the token entry in the database\n\nThe following function makes an SQL query to check if the token exists in the table.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n#### 7. If no entry exists, declare the session invalid.\n\nThis function is called in a `Validator` class. If no entry exists, i.e. `selectUserIdFromToken.first()` returns false, an error message is displayed.\n\n  \n\n\n#### 8. Extract user information if an entry exists\n\nGiven a token if it exists, we can extract the corresponding `user_id` from the `token` table. Hence we can obtain all the user information, as a `user` table exists with all the user information with `user_id` as the primary key.  \n  \n\n\n#### 9. On logging out, delete the token\n\nOnce the user clicks on the logout button, the entry of token stored in the browser using the following javascript code.\n\n  \n\n\nOn the server side, we need to delete the token entry. This is a precautionary measure, if suppose the token is not deleted even on logout. Also, once user has logged out, the entry with the token becomes useless. So it should be deleted for reducing memory overhead.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nTo explore more, you can check out [OAuth 2](http://oauth.net/2/), popular for its use by Google APIs for authentication and authorization.\n",

And I discovered what I was using quite later.\n\n  \n\n\n### My Account, My Space\n\nChrome logs me in with my personal account, and it maintains a sync across all the devices I use. I love the way it gives the window my name, providing a sense that I own this browser, and its my personal space.\n\n  \n\n\n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nwnDq-mdcE4/Vo6EB1E9nzI/AAAAAAAAAtA/2oOqd2MwcCM/s1600/ChromeAccount.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nwnDq-mdcE4/Vo6EB1E9nzI/AAAAAAAAAtA/2oOqd2MwcCM/s1600/ChromeAccount.png)\n\n  \n\n\nIt syncs between all the devices I use, so I do not need to worry whether I am using Google Chrome on Ubuntu or Windows or Android. It even maintains the history sites visited on all devices.\n\nAny other person who wants to use my browser gets the Guest account, or I have Mozilla Firefox! :D\n\n  \n\n\n[![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-slCKEWfnDto/Vo6EdJc4MLI/AAAAAAAAAtI/eLmY7nYzFxg/s640/GuestAccount.png)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-slCKEWfnDto/Vo6EdJc4MLI/AAAAAAAAAtI/eLmY7nYzFxg/s1600/GuestAccount.png)\n\n### The Little Bookmark Icons\n\nThe best hack I use is the way to get my favourite sites all at once, by keeping all my bookmarks in front of my eyes, on the Bookmarks Bar.\n\nWhen adding bookmarks in the usual way it is done, my chrome can accommodate only 5/6 bookmarks that are visible. However, my bookmarks bar looks like this:\n\n  \n\n\n[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3CcuSchd1qk/Vo6IXOtJj0I/AAAAAAAAAtU/zHxZRm3enbM/s640/HighlightBookmarks.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3CcuSchd1qk/Vo6IXOtJj0I/AAAAAAAAAtU/zHxZRm3enbM/s1600/HighlightBookmarks.png)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nLoad the page completely that you want to bookmark, and star it. Choose the folder as 'Bookmarks Bar'. But before pressing 'Done' , remove the name, like this:\n\n  \n\n\n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aFu1vKK9DAA/Vo6IpE9hplI/AAAAAAAAAtc/entWJaiBM3Q/s640/AddBookmark.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-aFu1vKK9DAA/Vo6IpE9hplI/AAAAAAAAAtc/entWJaiBM3Q/s1600/AddBookmark.png)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nYou will see the logo added on your bookmark bar. Most of the sites are popular, and you can recognize them by their logo. Even if you don't, hovering over the logo displays the name of the site.\n\nThis is quite a popular trick, but trust me! I discovered this on my own!\n\n  \n\n\n### Bookmarks Manager\n\nThe poor Bookmarks Manager has loads of work to do.\n\nI know googling is easy, but it saves a lot of time if we categorize our frequently visited sites under a single folder.\n\n  \n\n\n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U1Tasjjg95o/Vo6JPBGE_nI/AAAAAAAAAtk/NacZDIIiKaU/s640/Folder.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-U1Tasjjg95o/Vo6JPBGE_nI/AAAAAAAAAtk/NacZDIIiKaU/s1600/Folder.png)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n### Open the most forgettable task on Startup\n\nWe open our browser many times a day, and your browser can remind of you a task you ususally forget.\n\nI use Toshl Finance Manager for managing my finance (try it! Its good), and it does its task pretty well.\n\nBut it can't help if I forget to make entries of daily transactions! set which pages we want to open automatically on start-up.\n\n  \n\n\n[![](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OfkYqPzh3_o/Vo6KFoRFlXI/AAAAAAAAAts/l8wc7OPxn_E/s400/StartUpPages.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-OfkYqPzh3_o/Vo6KFoRFlXI/AAAAAAAAAts/l8wc7OPxn_E/s1600/StartUpPages.png)\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nGoogle News once used to be a part of startup pages as well, it is my home page now.\n\n  \n\n\n### Password Manager\n\nI would not suggest using your browser to save your passwords. For me, my brain is smart enough to remember my passwords. But yes, there are several sites that make us register with them with their complicated password policy. And if you think you can escape with having a single password for all accounts, that is dangerous, [Read Here](https://askleo.com/why_is_it_important_to_have_different_passwords_on_different_accounts/). So, in this case, Chrome's Password Manager comes handy.\n\n  \n\n\nGoogle Chrome also has its own password generator, though I haven't used it.\n\n  \n\n\n[![](https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tl3eFsP5fP8/Vo6LABK-QPI/AAAAAAAAAt4/_90uSsvuyHQ/s320/PasswordGenerate.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tl3eFsP5fP8/Vo6LABK-QPI/AAAAAAAAAt4/_90uSsvuyHQ/s1600/PasswordGenerate.png)\n\n  \n\n\n### Chrome's Task Manager\n\nNow that you have opened 20 tabs on chrome and your chrome can't survive it any more. Comes to the rescue, chrome's very own task manager.\n\nIt displays all the processes that are running on chrome. We can choose which one to keep and which ones to kill.\n\n  \n\n\n[![](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WuMba1BAtHc/Vo6LTMUkfyI/AAAAAAAAAuA/jJfUp239BQA/s320/TaskManager.png)](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WuMba1BAtHc/Vo6LTMUkfyI/AAAAAAAAAuA/jJfUp239BQA/s1600/TaskManager.png)\n\n  \n\n\n### Save as pdf\n\n### Chrome offers a wonderful feature that lets me save some pages offline as pdf. Just press ctrl+p and choose 'save as pdf'. This feature is really handy when I want to keep some pages for offline viewing later.\n\n### Extensions\n\nGoogle Chrome offers a handful of extensions and here are a few I use:\n\n  \n\n\n#### RescueTime\n\nThis one is my favourite. It gives me a record of how much 'productive' I have been, by recording my activities on my computer and categorizing them.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Google Dictionary\n\nA very handy extension, it provides me the meaning of a word by simply double clicking on the word.\n\n  \n\n\n#### Pocket\n\nFor me, it is the tool of procrastination, a read it later.\n\n  \n\n\n#### BuiltWith Technology Profiler\n\nIt tells me in brief, the technologies any site is built with.\n\n  \n\n\n#### AdBlocker\n\nA controversial extension, it frees me from those adds and render a neat page. Especially, it removes the adds from Youtube, giving me a much better watching experience.\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\nI use tons of other extensions, and many more features of Google Chrome. I can't say that these may not exist in any other browser, but the seamless experience that chrome has provided me, I must say I am one of its loyal fans!!  \n  \n  \nUpdate: Try Firefox :P\n",

We know about several algorithms given in our textbooks, but we are seldom taught about how to start with them. So let's start!  \nThis is the implementation of a tree node:  \n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->  \n    struct node{\n    int data;\n    struct node *left;\n    struct node *right;\n    };\n\n    typedef struct node *nodeptr;  \nBefore calling a create function, we need to data field to label a tree node as well. So we modify the above declaration:  \n  \n  \n    struct node{\n    int label; //represents the node number of the tree (0 indexed)\n    int data;\n    struct node *left;\n    struct node *right;\n    };\n\n    typedef struct node *nodeptr;  \nNow, we will start creating a tree. We need a function that asks the user to enter the data for a node label. So we have the following prototype:    void createTree(nodeptr);\n\n### How do we symbolize if a node is leaf?\n\nWe initialize its children with data = -1.\n\nIn the main function, we need to create a root node:  \n\n\n  \n\n\n    int main(){\n    int data = -1;\n    int label = 0;\n    printf(\"Provide data for the root node\\n\");\n    scanf(\"%d\",&data);\n    nodeptr root = getnode(label,data);\n    createTree(root);\n    printf(\"\\n=====================Preorder Traversal====================\\n\");\n    pretrav(root);\n    return 0;\n    }\n\n  \n\n\nNow let's define thecreateTree(nodeptr root) function:\n\n<!-- HTML generated using hilite.me -->\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n    void createTree(nodeptr root){\n    if(root == NULL)\n    return;\n    //Initialize left and right subtrees, which are currently null\n    nodeptr left = root->left;\n    nodeptr right = root->right;\n    //input the left child\n    int data = -1;\n    printf(\"Provide data for the left child of node %d (Enter -1 if current node is leaf)\\n\",root->label);\n    scanf(\"%d\",&data);\n    if(data != -1){\n    left = getnode(2*(root->label)+1,data);\n    root->left = left;\n    }\n    //input the right child\n    data = -1;\n    printf(\"Provide data for the right child of node %d (Enter -1 if current node is leaf)\\n\",root->label);\n    scanf(\"%d\",&data);\n    if(data != -1){\n    right = getnode(2*(root->label)+2,data);\n    root->right = right;\n    }\n    createTree(left);\n    createTree(right);\n    }\n\n  \n\n\nLike we see in the main function above, we first use the getnode() function to get the root node, ask the user to enter the data for root node, call the createTree() function, and then ask data for subsequent nodes.  \n\n\nAs you can see, this is a recursive function, after taking the data for left and right nodes, you recur over the left and right subtrees.\n\nAs you can see, the left and right child of the root node are only initialized with data if data!= null, hence if the noed is leaf, we enter data as -1.  \n  \n  \nYou can find the code above [here](https://github.com/amita-shukla/programs/blob/master/TreeCreate.c) in C and [here](https://github.com/amita-shukla/programs/blob/master/TreeNode.java), [here](https://github.com/amita-shukla/programs/blob/master/Tree.java) in java.\n",

But, we can observe, that we do not need to go beyond a certain limiting condition, when we realize that a solution is not possible.\n\n  \n\n\n-   Take one row at a time.\n-   Now, given a row, consider one column at a time and check if it is \"safe\" to place the queen in the cell.\n-   If we find the column is safe, then place the queen, and make a recursive call to place the queen on the next row.\n-   If we can’t find one, backtrack by returning from the recursive call, and try to find another safe column in the previous row.\n\nSo, the main routine is `findSafeColumn(int row)`\n\n  \n\n\n|      1\n     2\n     3\n     4\n     5\n     6\n     7\n     8\n     9\n    10\n    11\n    12\n    13\n    14\n    15\n    16\n    17\n    18\n    19\n    20\n    21 |     private static void findSafeColumn(int row) {\n     if (row == (boardSize)) {\n      addBoard();\n      return;\n     }\n     \n     // iterate over each column\n     for (int col = 0; col < boardSize; col++) {\n      if (isSafe(row, col)) {\n       placeQueen(row, col);\n       \n       // move on to next row\n       findSafeColumn(row + 1);\n\n       // when we have got here, means backTracked.\n       // now remove the queen you have placed so as \n       //to check the next col\n       removeQueen(row, col);\n      }   \n     }\n    } |\n| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n\n  \nThis is the main outline of the whole program.\n\n  \n\n\nLine 2 forms the base case, that is, if the variable row becomes equal to the size of the board, then the present configuration can be added as one of the solutions.  \nThe method `addBoard()` does exactly that.  \n  \nThe methods `placeQueen()` and `removeQueen()` will be described later.  \n  \n\n\n### How to implement the chess board?\n\nWe can implement a chess board using a 2-D boolean array, like,  \n  \nprivate static boolean\\[]\\[] board;

 \nprivate static boolean\\[] upDiagEmpty;  \nprivate static boolean\\[] downDiagEmpty;  \n  \nAn entry in one of these arrays is  \ntrue if no queen is placed in the corresponding column or diagonal,  \nfalse otherwise  \n  \nBut now we need to map these boolean arrays to our 2 dimentional board:  \n\n\n| [![](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qiH-64xzPN4/VoV85r-YqyI/AAAAAAAAAsQ/OprNx8Q_AXM/s1600/DownDiag.png)](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qiH-64xzPN4/VoV85r-YqyI/AAAAAAAAAsQ/OprNx8Q_AXM/s1600/DownDiag.png) |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| upDiagonal = row + col                                                                                                                                                                            |\n\n  \n\n\n|   \n |     |\n| --- | --- |\n\n  \n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n  \n\n\n| [![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-znpNqpsZHR8/VoV85sEp0hI/AAAAAAAAAsM/CVq84A0BCEg/s1600/UpDiag.png)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-znpNqpsZHR8/VoV85sEp0hI/AAAAAAAAAsM/CVq84A0BCEg/s1600/UpDiag.png) |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| downDiagonal = (boardSize - 1) + row - col                                                                                                                                                    |\n\n  \n\n\nWe use these additional arrays as follows:\n\n  \n\n\n|     1\n    2\n    3\n    4\n    5\n    6 |     private static void removeQueen(int row, int col) {\n     board[row][col] = false;\n     colEmpty[col] = true;\n     upDiagEmpty[row + col] = true;\n     downDiagEmpty[boardSize - 1 + row - col] = true;\n    } |\n| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n  \n\n\n|     1\n    2\n    3\n    4\n    5\n    6 |     private static void placeQueen(int row, int col) {\n     board[row][col] = true;\n     colEmpty[col] = false;\n     upDiagEmpty[row + col] = false;\n     downDiagEmpty[boardSize - 1 + row - col] = false;\n    } |\n| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n\n|     1\n    2\n    3\n    4\n    5\n    6\n    7\n    8\n    9 |     private static boolean isSafe(int row, int col) {\n     // if col & up diag & down diag is empty, then the given position is\n     // safe\n     if (colEmpty[col] && upDiagEmpty[row + col]\n       && downDiagEmpty[boardSize - 1 + row - col]) {\n      return true;\n     }\n     return false;\n    } |\n| ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |\n\n  \nTo save all the solutions of N-Queens problem, we can have an arraylist named `solutions` as follows:  \nstatic ArrayList&lt;ArrayList&lt;String>> solutions;

            "rawMarkdownBody": "\nAs I was checking out some programming questions on the topic linked list, it was boring to just read the programs without implementing them.  \nSo, I decided to try out linked list again, trying to devise out some more efficient ways to solve a very simple problem.  \nBut before playing with the list, I needed to create a list.  \n  \nDuring the process, I revised an old concept:  \nWhy do we need to use double pointer whenever we need to change the head pointer?  \nThe function that I had to write was `insbgn()`.  \n  \n**Insertion at the beginning of the list:**  \n  \nInitial declarations:  \n\n\n     struct node{  \n         int data;  \n         struct node *next;  \n     };  \n       \n     typedef struct node *nodeptr;  \n\n  \nOn can think of the following implementation:  \n\n\n     void insbgn(nodeptr head, int data){  \n         nodeptr p = getnode();  \n         p->next = head;  \n         head = p;      \n     }  \n\n  \nBut you will observe no changes if you make a call to this function:  \n\n\n     print(head); //output: 1 2 3 4 5 6  \n     insbgn(head, 0);  \n     print(head); //output 1 2 3 4 5 6     \n\n  \nThis is because the head pointer is changing here.  \nwhen `insbgn()` is called,  \nthe pointer 'head' points to the head of the list.  \nChanges are made to the list accordingly but as soon as the function returns, the changes to the head are lost.  \n  \nTo show this, if I call print(head) from inside insbgn():  \n\n\n     void insbgn(nodeptr head, int data){  \n         nodeptr p = getnode();  \n         p->next = head;  \n         head = p;  \n         print(head);      \n     }  \n\n  \nThe output is:  \n  \n\n\n     print(head); //output: 1 2 3 4 5 6  \n     insbgn(head, 0); //output: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6  \n     print(head); //output 1 2 3 4 5 6  \n\n  \nHence you need to pass double pointer, i.e. pointer to the head pointer.  \n  \nSo, the correct way to define `insbgn()` is as follows:  \n  \n\n\n     void insbgn(nodeptr *headptr, int data){ //you get a pointer to the head pointer  \n         nodeptr p = getnode(data);  \n         p->next = *headptr; // p->next points to the value at headptr, i.e. the head of the list  \n         *headptr = p; // the value at headptr is set to p, i.e., head = p.  \n     }   \n\n  \nAs we have the pointer to the head, we can easily dereference it and manipulate the real head.  \nIf you do not know any other example than the swap problem for pass by value and pass by reference, this is another one you can count on!  \nBut if you really want to use the previous version, you will need to return the new head back:  \n  \n\n\n     nodeptr insbgn(nodeptr head, int data){  \n          nodeptr p = getnode(data);  \n          p->next = head;     head = p;  \n         printf(\"Linked list inside insbgn\\n\");  \n          print(head);  \n          printf(\"\\n\");  \n          return head;  \n      }  \n\n  \nAnd call it like:  \n`head = insbgn(head,data);`  \nThe problem with this approach is that you can assign the new head, and later go mad figuring where you got wrong.\n",
