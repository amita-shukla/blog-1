__Hi :wave: I'm Amita__. I have around 7 years of experience as a __Software Developer__, am based in India. My expertise lies in building __Backend, Big Data and Cloud-based applications__, though I also take on database, frontend, machine learning work from time to time. 

I am a programmer at heart and love building and learning stuff using code. A screen of clean code gives me the same feeling as opening a page from a fresh book. My father brought home a desktop when I was 10, back then it was just a sophisticated toy for me. I have come a long way since then, from using applications to writing them.

### My Tech Stack
A chunk of my experience has gone into designing & coding __REST web services__, engines and frameworks using __Java/Spring__, batch and streaming data transformations using __Scala/Spark/Kafka/Hive/MapReduce__, Natural Language Processing using Python/R, and SQL/Python/Shell Scripting. 

On the frontend side, I have worked with React and vanilla Javascript, and a little bit with Purescript. This blog I maintain is mainly built on React and GraphQL. Further in the past, I have also switched gears between Haskell, Groovy, .Net/C#, PHP, C++. Overtime, I have gotten more inclined towards __type safe languages__.
