<br/>

Hi :wave: I'm Amita. I am Software Engineer with around 5 years of experience. I mostly work in the Big Data & Cloud Ecosystem, creating magic on data using  Scala, Java, SQL and Bash. I maintain this blog built mainly on React, and also enjoy Machine Learning/ Python. 

Having said all that, I do not restrict myself to the programming language but rather focus on the purpose it solves, having switched gears from Haskell, Groovy, .Net/ C#, PHP, C++ in the past. I am passionate about writing clean and maintanable code, and over the time have inclined more towards type safe languages.

Dive into my thoughts [here](https://amitashukla.in/blog). Being passionate about programming and writing I combine these into this blog, sharing the little pieces of knowledge that I attain.
