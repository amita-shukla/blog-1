## Move to locations

`Ctrl+o` navigate to the previous location in the jump list (think o as old)
`Ctrl+i` navigate to the next location in the jump list (i and o are usually next to each other)
`g;` go to the previous change location
`g,` go to the newer change location
`gi` place the cursor at the same position where it was left last time in the Insert mode
