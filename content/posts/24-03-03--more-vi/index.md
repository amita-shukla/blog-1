## Common Applications to Use Vim in
- IdeaVim
- Vimium
- terminal keybinding: `set -o vi` [https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4870/is-it-possible-to-have-vim-key-bindings-in-terminal]

## Common Vim Commands
- `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` 
- `H`
- `J`
- `K`
- `L`
- `u` undo
- `ctrl + r` redo

## Word Navigation
- `w` move to first char of the next word (a word is separated by any punctuation except underscore)
- `b`
- `e`
- `ge`
- `W` move to first char of the next WORD (the next character after whitespace)
- `ciw` change the word where your cursor is
- `dt<char>` 
- `df<char>`
- `shift + [` and `shift + ]` Move cursor block-wise - moves cursor up and down the block of code.
- `shift + v` select the current block 
- `10j` move a certain number of lines: select the number of lines when you donâ€™t have a block of code: `shift + v + 10j` would do the trick.
- `%` toggle between 2 parentheses 
- `*` move to next occurrence of the current word
- `^` or `0w` move to beginning of the first word of the line 

## Move to locations

- `Ctrl+o` navigate to the previous location in the jump list (think o as old)
- `Ctrl+i` navigate to the next location in the jump list (i and o are usually next to each other)
- `g;` go to the previous change location
- `g,` go to the newer change location
- `gi` place the cursor at the same position where it was left last time in the Insert mode

## Surround a word with quotes (or any other character)
`c` `i` `w` `"` `"` `Esc` `P`
Replace `iw` with any other Vim motion/text object to surround other things with quotes
